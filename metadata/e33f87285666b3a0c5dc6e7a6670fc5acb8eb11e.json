Anita Raghavan, NYT.\r\n\r\nâ€œI met Khan in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in September, five months after she was released from prison and three months after she was transferred from a halfway house to her own home. I wanted to understand how a highly intelligent woman like Khan â€” she has a degree in engineering, two in physics and an M.B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley â€” wound up committing a crime like this. What sorts of calculations had she made to convince herself that the benefits of cheating outweighed the possible costs?\r\n\r\nâ€œKhan was wary of me. She felt bruised by the way the media had demonized her. All but one of her friends from her California days had abandoned her. Since moving to Florida, she has channeled her energies into raising her only child, her adopted daughter, Priyanka. â€œI have no outside-world connections,â€ she told me. Oddly, she was worried that if she agreed to be interviewed for an article, people might think she was paid for her story. (The New York Times does not pay for interviews.) After vetting the idea with her lawyer and her probation officer, she agreed to sit down and tell me about her life.\r\n\r\nâ€œI had seen so many unattractive photographs of Khan that I was surprised when a spunky woman with large, lively eyes and carefully blow-dried hair bounded up to me in my hotel lobby. Khan, who is about 5-foot-2 and svelte, was dressed in a loosefitting cotton blouse and skinny jeans and carried a horseshoe-shaped, fuchsia Louis Vuitton bag and an iPad on which she tracks a handful of stocks â€” Apple, Caterpillar and Cummins. She said she has no money to invest. â€œI do it for the intellectual curiosity. Otherwise my mind would be mush.â€â€¦â€\r\n \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/magazine/can-a-stock-trader-turned-convict-start-a-new-life.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e33f87285666b3a0c5dc6e7a6670fc5acb8eb11e","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Insidrmation+Talks+May+16+2016.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e33f87285666b3a0c5dc6e7a6670fc5acb8eb11e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,63,135,40,86,102,179,160,197,220,110,122,102,112,252,90,203,142,177,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
