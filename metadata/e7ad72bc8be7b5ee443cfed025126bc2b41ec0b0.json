Would more citizens with guns have made the attacks much less deadly? We debate that. Also, although the Supreme Court ruled that individuals have a right to bear arms, I tried to get a gun license in New York City but was rejected.\r\n\r\nGUN MYTHS: Dana Loesch busts myths about guns: phony &quot;assault weapons,&quot; President Obama and Hillary Clinton's false claims about mass shootings, and the famous &quot;gun show loophole.&quot;\r\n\r\nNEGROES WITH GUNS: Today most blacks favor gun control over gun rights. &quot;Negroes and the Gun&quot; author Nicholas Johnson explains that's a relatively new phenomenon; blacks historically relied on guns for protection against oppression from the state and individual racists.\r\n\r\nARMED AND FEMALE: Kristina Ribali wishes more so-called feminists would get behind female gun-ownership. She's a mom who calls firearms &quot;the great equalizer&quot; because it makes women as powerful as men. She tells me, it wasn't the cops who kept her and her family safe from a repeat stalker, but her gun.\r\n\r\nZERO TOLERANCE: The stupidity continues. Examples: a 7-year-old boy is suspended from school for shaping a pop-tart into what his teacher thought looked like a gun; a 5-year-old girl is suspended for a &quot;terrorist threat&quot; that turned out to be a â€˜Hello Kitty' gun, and kids suspended for using fingers as â€˜guns'\r\n\r\nMY TAKE: I argue that the Second Amendment is not about allowing people the right to shoot deer, it's about allowing us to protect ourselves from criminals and tyrants","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ad72bc8be7b5ee443cfed025126bc2b41ec0b0","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.12.04.Self.Defenseless.720p.WEBrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7ad72bc8be7b5ee443cfed025126bc2b41ec0b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,173,114,188,139,231,181,238,68,60,254,208,37,18,107,194,180,30,192,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
