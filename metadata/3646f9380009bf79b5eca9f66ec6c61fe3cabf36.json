In the decade since the publication of the last edition, the study of reproductive physiology has undergone monumental changes. Chief among these advances are in the areas of stem cell development, signaling pathways, the role of inflammation in the regulatory processes in the various tissues, and the integration of new animal models which have led to a greater understanding of human disease. The new edition synthesizes all of this new information at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels of organization and present modern physiology a more understandable and comparative context.\r\n\r\n* The Fourth Edition has been extensively revised, reflecting new fundamental advancements in this rapidly advancing field.\r\n\r\n* Provides a common language for researchers across the fields of physiology, endocrinology, and biology to discuss their understanding of reproduction.\r\n\r\n* Saves academic researchers time in quickly accessing the very latest details on reproductive physiology, as opposed to searching through thousands of journal articles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3646f9380009bf79b5eca9f66ec6c61fe3cabf36","amp;dn":"Knobil+and+Neill%27s+Physiology+of+Reproduction+-+4thEd2Vol+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3646f9380009bf79b5eca9f66ec6c61fe3cabf36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,70,249,56,0,9,191,121,181,236,169,246,110,198,198,31,227,202,191,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
