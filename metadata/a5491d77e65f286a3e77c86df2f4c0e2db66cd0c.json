[...] Based in Rome, they played under the name FLEA ON THE HONEY at the 1971 Viareggio Pop Festival. Later that same year they recorded their self-title debut, which was a decidedly English-influenced hard rock album. [...]  \r\n\r\nAfter more live activity, including an appearance at the Rome Villa Pamphili Festival and a mini-tour with Metamorfosi and Garybaldi, the band shortened their name to FLEA and recorded their best album in 1972, &quot;Topi o Uomini&quot;. [...] Flea then broke up for a short time, but in 1975 the original four members reunited and changed their name to ETNA. Their only eponymous album represents a major shift in musical style to Jazz Rock, not unlike Nova and  Il BaricentroÂ».
