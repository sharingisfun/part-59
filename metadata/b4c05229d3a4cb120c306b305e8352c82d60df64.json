It runs in the system tray and allows user to control the native firewall easily without having to waste time by navigating to the specific part of the firewall. This is the best tool to manage the native firewall from Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7, Vista, Server 2008, Server 2012. Windows Firewall Control offers four filtering modes which can be switched with just a mouse click:\r\n\r\nHigh Filtering - All outbound and inbound connections are blocked. This setting blocks all attempts to connect to and from your computer.\r\nMedium Filtering - Outbound connections that do not match a rule are blocked. Only the programs that you allow can initiate outbound connections.\r\nLow Filtering - Outbound connections that do not match a rule are allowed. The user can block the programs he doesn't want to allow initiating outbound connections.\r\nNo Filtering - Windows Firewall is turned off. Avoid using this setting unless you have another firewall running on your computer.\r\nProgram Features\r\n\r\nâˆš Intuitive and easy accessible interface in the system tray, next to the system clock.\r\nâˆš Full support with standard user accounts.
