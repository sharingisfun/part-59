The letter was provided to USA TODAY by two administration officials who would not discuss it publicly because it hadn't been sent.\r\n\r\n&quot;When a school provides sex-segregated activities and facilities, transgender students must be allowed to participate in such activities and access such facilities consistent with their gender identity,&quot; reads the letter, signed by two Obama administration officials responsible for enforcing civil rights laws: Assistant Secretary of Education Catherine E. Lhamon, and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta.\r\n\r\nSen.
