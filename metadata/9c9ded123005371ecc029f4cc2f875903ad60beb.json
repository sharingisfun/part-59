Since its first outing in 1993, Terrorizer has put out over 200 issues jam packed with the most brutal new extreme music on the planet every single month. Take a look at the bands on our cover for an idea and remember that Terrorizer pioneered forms of music and covered artists that no-one else would touch, name it and we were probably there first! If you're a real metal or hardcore fan, you really should be reading Terrorizer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c9ded123005371ecc029f4cc2f875903ad60beb","amp;dn":"Terrorizer+-+January+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c9ded123005371ecc029f4cc2f875903ad60beb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,157,237,18,48,5,55,30,204,2,159,76,194,248,117,144,58,214,11,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
