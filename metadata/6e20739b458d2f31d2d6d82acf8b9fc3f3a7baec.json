This has also been pointed out to me by another user, but up until now, I had no way of checking.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this one has been remuxed all over again, and all the FLACs sox-tested on independent channels (Pk lev dB and RMS Pk dB against infinity). End result: no proprietary DTS-HD MA, just lovely bit-perfect FLAC, as with the rest of the stuff I share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e20739b458d2f31d2d6d82acf8b9fc3f3a7baec","amp;dn":"twasnme+-+Strar+Trek%3A+Enterprise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e20739b458d2f31d2d6d82acf8b9fc3f3a7baec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,32,115,155,69,141,47,49,210,214,216,42,207,139,159,195,243,167,186,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
