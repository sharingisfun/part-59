In SimCity youâ€™ll take control of a living, breathing town, full of citizens who have their own identities and ideas. Setting up your city is deceptively simple; the real challengeâ€”and the real funâ€”comes from managing the complex, robust environment youâ€™ve created.\r\n\r\nYouâ€™ll also get to interact with other online players in real time. You can offer to share your resources, or hoard your goods for pure profit. The new building tools make it easy to play the way you want, but remember: When dealing with pollution, crime and natural disasters, it might be a good idea to have friends to help you out.\r\n\r\nBe the boss. Build the society youâ€™ve always dreamed of. The only limits are those of your ambition. Can you create a city that will stand the test of time?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04bc3c7227c368758d021e96d40b2fbded89340a","amp;dn":"SimCity%26trade%3B+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04bc3c7227c368758d021e96d40b2fbded89340a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,188,60,114,39,195,104,117,141,2,30,150,212,11,47,189,237,137,52,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
