She starts out on Capri, which, with its beauty, glamour and history, has been a celebrated holiday destination since Roman times. She enjoys its signature style, which she claims has never gone out of fashion. On Ischia, she scales the rocky heights of the medieval Aragonese Castle, before hopping across to the remote Aeolian island of Salina, where she samples the famous Malvasia wine. Finally she travels to Filicudi, an island that holds a special place in her heart.\r\n\r\n3)  Northern Sicily \r\nAlex continues her tour with a visit to the north of Sicily, revealing a different side to the largest island in the Mediterranean. She discovers overwhelming opulence at a palace in Palermo, meets an inspirational mayor and viewing an army of mummified monks who are giving scientists new insights into island life in the past. She also learns how the Mafia have influenced Sicilian life for decades from a group of locals determined to bring about change.\r\n\r\n4)  Southern Sicily \r\nAlex is still on Sicily as she concludes her odyssey, travelling to the south to explore the island's diverse beauty and fascinating history, from the serenity of the baroque town of Ragusa to the breathtaking Turkish Steps cascading down to the sea. She also experiences the hidden wonder of one of the world's two subterranean cathedrals, located hundreds of metres below sea level in a salt mine, drops in on a family friend on the mysterious island of Pantelleria, and enjoys a fiesta in the idyllic fishing village of San Vito.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/89/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4a/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8d/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/ff/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fe/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ef/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1d/Italian-Islands-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3163 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 985 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/dvr5x5/alex-polizzis-italian-islands/episodeguide/series-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4f89614834fdf82690d9cf97809a569b7b4be1d","amp;dn":"Ch5+Alex+Polizzis+Italian+Islands+Series+1+1of4+Sardinia+720p+x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4f89614834fdf82690d9cf97809a569b7b4be1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,248,150,20,131,79,223,130,105,13,156,249,120,9,165,105,183,180,190,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
