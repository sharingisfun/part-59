She then ran a voice vote before many of Bernie's delegates were even certified to make it into a permanent rule.\r\n\r\nIt was clear she didn't have the support of a 2/3rd quorum, yet she steamrolled the rules permanency into place.  This was the start of what turned out to be a very bad day for democracy within the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nEventually, they refused to certify 64 Sanders supporters (Clinton had 8 excluded), yet they were all certified and accepted at the county level voting from tier 2. - which seems like an effort to suppress the vote. - This resulted in Hillary &quot;winning&quot; by 32 delegates.\r\n\r\nThe MSM have turned their back on this and are running headlines trying to push the Berniebro meme, with reportage solely of the reaction to Lange being framed as nothing more than Sanders supporters &quot;Booing at women&quot;.  They're trying to ignore it or frame it.\r\n\r\nAs a precaution against bogus take-down requests from Hillary's super PACs (eg. David Brock's &quot;Correct The Record&quot; propaganda ministry) - this archive was made to backup the videos posted to YouTube,Twitter and Periscope.\r\n\r\nThe revolution will not be televised","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09bfbea9493af2652f52b415163fe674c34fd448","amp;dn":"Nevada+Democratic+Convention+-+14+May+2016+-+36+videos+backed+up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09bfbea9493af2652f52b415163fe674c34fd448","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,191,190,169,73,58,242,101,47,82,180,21,22,63,230,116,195,79,212,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
