An audible tome of soul-eviscerating song selections that deeply delved into itsâ€™ listenerâ€™s souls and then kneaded said soul with emotional bewitchment and seduction. \r\nOf course I am referring to the six-song EP Black Magic Man released earlier this year by Psychedelic Witchcraft, the name now bestowed upon the collective creativity brought to life by the stunning enchantress Virginia Monti. \r\n\r\nIf you are not hip to this release or the imminent full-length one soon arriving, The Vision, then you have happened upon the perfect band to learn of on this day, October 31st, 2015â€¦Halloween. Steeped in ages old occultism in itsâ€™ content, the EP is the ideal introduction to the increasingly more sought after vintage sound of a bygone era.  \r\n \r\nTITLES: Black Magic Man (EP)4trks / Set Me Free (Single)2trks\r\n   \r\nYEAR : 2015\r\n   \r\nCOUNTRY: Italy\r\n    \r\nSTYLE: Vintage Hard Rock, Heavy Occult Rock, Psychedelic Rock\r\n   \r\nDURATION: 0:27:24\r\n   \r\nFILE FORMAT: MP3\r\n  \r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlayers...?\r\n\r\nI had help for the main guitar and the drums, bass was played by the guy that played the main guitar in the EP I played the guitar as well. \r\nIt was cool they are good musicians they just played my songs did it right and it was it. \r\nI try to convince them to make the band with me but they didn't want to ... they said that my music was not interesting at all and they didn't want to play in a band that put Satan and Witches in their songs. \r\nSo I said OK that's fine I will be alone.\r\nVirginia Monti during interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n2015 Black Magic Man (EP) 00:18:38\r\n\r\n01 Angela\r\n02 Lying on Iron\r\n03 Black Magic Man\r\n04 Slave of Grief\r\n\r\n2015 Set Me Free (Single) 00:08:45\r\n\r\n01 Set Me Free\r\n02 Wicked Dream\r\n\r\nWell aspiring players she's looking for a band,time to step up eh?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b72e5d894a8d5253438328257b4a6ee0bd0f70c9","amp;dn":"Psychedelic+Witchcraft+-+Black+Magic+Man+%28EP%29+2015+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b72e5d894a8d5253438328257b4a6ee0bd0f70c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,46,93,137,74,141,82,83,67,131,40,37,123,74,110,224,189,15,112,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
