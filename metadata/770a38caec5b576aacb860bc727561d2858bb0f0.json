M. Niemeyer and C. A. Mirkin (Wiley-VCH, 2004).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 3-527-30658-7\r\n\r\nNanotechnology is the key technology of the 21st century. The possibility to exploit the structures and processes of biomolecules for novel functional materials, biosensors, bioelectronics and medical applications has created the rapidly growing field of nanobiotechnology.\r\nDesigned as a broad survey of the field, this book combines contributions from bioorganic and bioinorganic chemistry, molecular biology, materials science and bioanalytics to fathom the full scope of current and future developments.\r\nIt is divided into four main sections:\r\n* Interphase Systems\r\n* Protein-based Nanostructures\r\n* DNA-based Nanostructures\r\n* Nanoanalytics\r\nEach chapter describes in detail currently available methods and contains numerous references to the primary literature, making this the perfect &quot;field guide&quot; for chemists, biologists and materials scientists who want to explore the fascinating world of nanobiotechnology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:770a38caec5b576aacb860bc727561d2858bb0f0","amp;dn":"Nanobiotechnology+-+Concepts%2C+Applications+and+Perspectives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"770a38caec5b576aacb860bc727561d2858bb0f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,10,56,202,236,91,87,106,172,184,96,188,114,117,97,210,133,139,176,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
