Rachel cooks as she goes, for her crew and participants, usually outside in the elements and subject to the vagaries of the Irish weather. Taken away from the relative comforts of the kitchen, Rachel's Coastal Cooking plays to her natural curiosity and sense of fun while showcasing some of the best of Ireland's produce and the people behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel's Coastal Cooking - Season 1, Episode 1\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this episode Rachel Allen travels from Dungarvan to Ballycotton as she embarks on her coastal cooking adventure.
