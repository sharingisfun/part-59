The Crystal Method's\r\nmusic has appeared in numerous TV shows, films, video games, and advertisements.\r\nTheir best-selling album, Vegas, was certified platinum in 2007.\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Community Service&quot; Profile\r\n\r\n\r\nJordan and Kirkland used to have a radio show called &quot;Community Service&quot; which\r\naired Friday nights on radio station Indie 103.1, in California. They played music\r\nand hosted guests, like Death in Vegas and UNKLE. Their show came back on air in\r\n2011 and airs weekly on Sirius XMs Channel 52.\r\n\r\nA year after the release of Tweekend, The Crystal Method released a continuous mix\r\nalbum based on their radio show, titled Community Service.
