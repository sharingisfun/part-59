Travelling along the infamous â€˜Axis of Evilâ€™ led to Tony Wheelerâ€™s Bad Lands â€“ now heâ€™s going deeper into the worldâ€™s darkest corners to explore a rogueâ€™s gallery of troubled nations. Every country has its problems, but some problems seem so vexed, so intractable, so absurd, you can only shake your head. Tony Wheeler trains his well-travelled eyes on some of these places and attempts to understand how things got so messed up. Along the way he gets stoned (with the thrown variety) in Palestine, scores a speeding ticket in Zimbabwe, gets arrested for photographing a bar in the Congo, and visits Osama bin Ladenâ€™s Abbottabad in Pakistan. Join Tony and find out if thereâ€™s a happily-ever-after in these tales from the dark side.
