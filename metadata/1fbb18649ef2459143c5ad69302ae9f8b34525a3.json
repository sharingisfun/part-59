(AMG)\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite what the movie may say about buying products to make your life better and make you a better person, buying this CD WILL make you a better person. Why? Because you're giving your ears something different to listen to instead of the same old, same old that gets repeated without remorse on the radio. You'll be expanding your mind; you'll be opening it to new experiences in creative music.\r\nWhen listening to the &quot;Fight Club&quot; soundtrack, your mind will conjure the scenes of the film, placing the events to the music that intertwine to please your mind. It's most certainly a different arrangement of music than most film soundtracks, but &quot;Fight Club&quot; wasn't most films.\r\nBeware before you hit any &quot;purchase&quot; button or trek off to your local CD store: the US release of the &quot;Fight Club&quot; soundtrack does not feature the 16th track &quot;This Is Your Life,&quot; featuring music by the Dust Brothers and spoken dialogue by Brad Pitt; the Australian release contains that track. If you loved the movie, you don't want to pass that little factoid up. Also, the song that closes the film and accompanies the closing credits in a &quot;Dr. Stragelove&quot;-type fashion cannot be found on this CD. The song featured in the closing credits is &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot; by The Pixies. Look for it on The Pixies &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; release.\r\nBuy this CD. Your ears will thank you.
