Harris.\r\n\r\nâ€œNo one writes about World War I with more empathy and understanding than Stephen Harris. In Rock of the Marne, he achieves a new level of drama and significance. In their stand on the Marne, the raw Americans of the Third Infantry Division changed the history of the war, the history of Europe, even the history of the world. Harris brings this epochal event alive with breathtaking vividness and skill.â€â€”Thomas Fleming, author of The Illusion of Victory: America in World War I\r\n\r\nâ€œA hundred years ago, the German Army was on the way to Paris. But on the Marne River, some 27,000 brave American doughboys of the Third Division thought otherwise. The resultant clash of arms decided the Great War. Author Stephen L. Harris puts you right in the middle of the action. He tells it like it was: good, bad, and ugly, from baby-faced machine-gunners and hard-bitten sergeants fighting for their lives to exhausted colonels and generals trying to sort it all out under fire. This is military history as its meant to be.â€â€”Daniel P. Bolger, Lt. Gen. U.S. Army. Ret., author of Why We Lost: A General's Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars\r\n\r\nâ€œStephen Harris has written a thrilling account of a critical, but mostly forgotten, battle of the Great War, which includes an unforgettable portrait of a magnificent American warrior, Col. Ulysses McAlexander.â€â€”Michael Hanlon, First World War Editor and Publisher\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4721fab00b0ffd2421b2c4942ac2a84067e4259e","amp;dn":"American-soldiers-turned-tide-against-kaiser-world-war-1.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4721fab00b0ffd2421b2c4942ac2a84067e4259e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,33,250,176,11,15,253,36,33,178,196,148,42,194,168,64,103,228,37,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
