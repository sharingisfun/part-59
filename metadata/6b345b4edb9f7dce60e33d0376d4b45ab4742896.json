Rage! Blow! \r\nYou cataracts and hurricanoes, spout \r\nTill you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks! \r\nYou sulphurour and thought-executing fires, \r\nVaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts, \r\nSinge my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder, \r\nStrike flat the thick rotundity o' the world! \r\nCrack nature's molds, all germens spill at once \r\nThat make ingrateful man!â€ \r\n\r\nThough set in â€˜cold, dim and gloomyâ€™ ancient Britain, and first performed c.1605 at about the beginning of the early modern age, the play itself is one of the first evidences of a disturbed cosmos. . Himself a ruin shaken by the frame of Nature, Learâ€™s outcries recall â€˜the lamentation of the wind amid a labyrinth of ruined masonryâ€™ (the first scene of Olivierâ€™s ITV version was set at Stonehenge)\r\n\r\nGielgudâ€™s final version of King Lear, done with Kenneth Brannaghâ€™s Renaissance Theatre Company in 1994 (at the age of 90) and broadcast by the BBC.
