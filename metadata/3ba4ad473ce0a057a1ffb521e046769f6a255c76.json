B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of A Song\r\nof Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the\r\nfirst of which is titled A Game of Thrones. Filmed in a Belfast studio\r\nand on location elsewhere in Northern Ireland, Malta, Scotland, Croatia,\r\nIceland and Morocco, it premiered on HBO in the United States on April\r\n17, 2011. The series completed airing its fifth season on June 14, 2015,\r\nand has been renewed for a sixth season.\r\n\r\nSeven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros.\r\nPolitical and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Robert Baratheon, King of\r\nWesteros, asks his old friend Eddard, Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of\r\nthe King, or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous Hand\r\nwas assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further.\r\nMeanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to\r\ntake power.\r\n\r\nAcross the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed\r\nruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne.\r\nThe friction between the houses Stark, Lannister and Baratheon, and with\r\nthe remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell, leads to\r\nfull-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nAmidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of\r\nmisfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of\r\nmen and icy horrors beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPISODE LIST:\r\n\r\n\r\nS05E01 The Wars to Come\r\nS05E02 The House of Black and White\r\nS05E03 High Sparrow\r\nS05E04 Sons of the Harpy\r\nS05E05 Kill the Boy\r\nS05E06 Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\r\nS05E07 The Gift\r\nS05E08 Hardhome\r\nS05E09 The Dance of Dragons\r\nS05E10 Mother's Mercy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba4ad473ce0a057a1ffb521e046769f6a255c76","amp;dn":"Game+Of+Thrones+Season+5+720p+HD+bluray-rip+suchDLwow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba4ad473ce0a057a1ffb521e046769f6a255c76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,164,173,71,60,224,160,87,161,255,181,33,224,70,118,159,106,37,92,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
