The heat and hard work makes them consider whether they can do this alone or need to take advantage of the cheap staff costs to settle here.\r\n\r\nMiriam is constantly full of great one-liners and fun observations that colour everything with humour. Jaipur is full of hundreds of years of history, best seen in its impressive buildings, so the group head out to visit the jewel in Jaipur's crown, the 500-year-old Amer Fort. Their guide also offers to show them his local home where they begin to understand the gulf between rich and poor and the impact of the caste system. They are also invited to take tea with Jaipur's royal family at the opulent Rambagh Palace, mixing with high society in the finest surroundings.\r\n\r\nWayne makes the most of his wish to explore his spiritual side by attending the daily morning prayers and visiting the beautiful Galti Ji temple, which is home to a troop of monkeys. Rosemary, finding it hard to unwind from her normal hectic life, tries meditation for the first time and is surprised by the results.\r\n\r\nTo end their first week, they throw a party with performances to meet their new neighbours as they start to feel more at home on the other side of the world.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 1 022 MiB\r\nDuration : 59mn 27s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 404 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf0f855596a0d49dcc192538cc754a5ecd83abf","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Real+Marigold+Hotel+Episode+1of3+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf0f855596a0d49dcc192538cc754a5ecd83abf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,240,248,85,89,106,13,73,220,193,146,83,140,199,84,165,236,216,58,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
