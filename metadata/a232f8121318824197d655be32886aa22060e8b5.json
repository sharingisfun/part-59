Explore the phenomenon of mixingâ€”a crucial process for any situation where the product is composed of more than one material. Focus on the case of oil and water, which are notoriously unmixable, and discover what keeps them separate at the molecular level.\r\n18 Melting and Freezing of Mixtures\r\n19 The Carnot Engine and Limits of Efficiency\r\n20 More Enginesâ€”Materials at Work\r\n21 The Electrochemical Potential\r\n22 Chemical Reactionsâ€”Getting to Equilibrium\r\n23 The Chemical Reaction Quotient\r\n24 The Greatest Processes in the World\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompresed with handbrake\r\nsettings:\r\n   video: RF 23, x264 preset Very Fast, x264 Tune Film\r\n   audio: bitrate 80\r\n\r\nif you want mp3s only, use panzera \nhttp://www.pazera-software.com/products/audio-extractor/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a232f8121318824197d655be32886aa22060e8b5","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Thermodynamics+%28compressed+2Gb%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a232f8121318824197d655be32886aa22060e8b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,50,248,18,19,24,130,65,151,214,85,190,50,136,106,162,32,96,232,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
