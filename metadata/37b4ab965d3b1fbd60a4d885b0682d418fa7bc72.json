The Three Strikes Act funnels the unemployed masses into a national network of work camps for the most trivial of infractions.\r\n\r\nLando Cruz is a scrappy rebel who risks his final strike on the streets of Philadelphia by trading illegal currencies under cover of a burrito stand. He spends his days bribing dirty cops, fending off undercover federal agents and shepherding his little sister through adolescence.\r\n\r\nLando is getting by until beat cops seize his savings and kidnap his sister for ransom. He has thirty days to raise the hard cash he needs to free her before she is sold into sex slavery. His only chance is a lucrative job offer from the black market rebellion's paramilitary startup, the Core. He risks both his life and his principles to get his sister back before time runs out","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37b4ab965d3b1fbd60a4d885b0682d418fa7bc72","amp;dn":"Lando+Cruz+and+the+Coup+Conspiracy+-+George+Donnelly+%28Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37b4ab965d3b1fbd60a4d885b0682d418fa7bc72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,180,171,150,93,59,31,189,96,164,216,133,176,104,45,65,143,167,188,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
