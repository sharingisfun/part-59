This is a PPV cap...maybe from a hotel in Hong Kong. Rarbt capped it fullscreen 60fps, 1080i, with bars, at a great bitrate. (there is no actual 1080p source on this).\r\n\r\nSource was 3D, so the blue gamma was gone (your 3D glasses provide that color). Put the blue back, and the colors are fine. (How, you ask? Took a couple pics at the local cinema, and corrected the gamma until it matched.  It's not rocket science.)  The color is really good. Not perfect, but really good.\r\n\r\nAudio is from SLAM's line. DPL2 source, so we just left it and converted to AAC with FDK.\r\n\r\nThis is out of spec with b-frames (8), so if your player is picky or can't handle NTSC pure, don't grab it -- the extra frames are the only way to get the motion right at 29.97.\r\n\r\nIs it perfect? No. But, FFS, a guy capped it in a hotel room in Asia somewhere, and another guy in Iowa grabbed some audio. And we put it all together.\r\n\r\nActually, come to think of it... It's a goddamn miracle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:526910403a4800ba1ad2e9624be7edcf7094244b","amp;dn":"Captain.America.Civil.War.2016.720p.HDTC.REFERENCE-mMx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"526910403a4800ba1ad2e9624be7edcf7094244b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,105,16,64,58,72,0,186,26,210,233,98,75,231,237,207,112,148,36,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
