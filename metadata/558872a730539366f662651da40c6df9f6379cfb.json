Philip Boucher-Hayes compares the industrial pan with homemade and sourdough rivals and investigates why so many people claim they're gluten intolerant. And when it comes to the humble carb that's most associated with Ireland, the spud, it turns out that sales to the under-45s are dropping steeply. Philip examines the rise of the small potato, is surprised by the sweet treats which contain spud and finds out how genetic modification may be the only way to stamp out blight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Dates: 13-Apr-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:558872a730539366f662651da40c6df9f6379cfb","amp;dn":"What+Are+You+Eating+S01E04+Webrip.XviD-SPiNZES.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"558872a730539366f662651da40c6df9f6379cfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,136,114,167,48,83,147,102,246,98,101,29,164,12,109,249,246,55,156,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
