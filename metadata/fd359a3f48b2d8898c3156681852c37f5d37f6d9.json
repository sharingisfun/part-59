Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuests:  Dave Smith, Luis J Gomez\r\n\r\nEpisode 285 â€œThe Elephant In The Roomâ€: After a horrific weekend things get even more horrific with Dave Smith temporarily sitting in to talk about standing by Ant, UFC, KtC calls in to explain Anthony being tardy, Luis J. Gomez calls to apologize for Dave, and Dave goes through last nightâ€™s Miss Universe fiasco, a disaster on the Vegas strip, offensive food, and Luis makes his way to the studio to â€œstand with Ant.â€ Dave and Luis talk about Reddit comments, Gavin calls to talk about watching personal things unfold in the media, publically shaming, and Ant finally makes his way to the desk. Anthony addresses his arrest, being advised to clam up, missing Joe DeRosa, and he breaks down his first jail experience, his cellmateâ€™s story, a hospital trip, his cell, and his mental mindset. The guys then discuss â€œjail folk,â€ awesome people who escape from jail, thug legal advice, the bus ride to court, the press being relentless, being in a cell, people in cells, and seeing the judge. Anthony thanks the fans and sponsors for the support, waxes on keeping perspective, they chat about Steve Harvey and Miss Universe, Miss Puerto Rico being anti- Muslim, hot teacher sex and fuckable teachers, and the callers chime in on Antâ€™s dating choices, the beer â€œcontroversy,â€ and Patrice Oâ€™Neal. Anthony reiterates what he can and canâ€™t say, we hear from a couple more callers, an old bag calls in to attempt to entice Ant, the guys talk about being a cuck, and they try to get Ant on a more age appropriate path.\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd359a3f48b2d8898c3156681852c37f5d37f6d9","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-12-21+Dave+Smith+Luis+J+Gomez","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd359a3f48b2d8898c3156681852c37f5d37f6d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,53,154,63,72,178,216,137,140,49,86,104,24,82,195,127,93,55,246,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
