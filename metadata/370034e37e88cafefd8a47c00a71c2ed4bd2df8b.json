Paul Manafort: 'Fiorina is the queen of outsourcing jobs; Cruz picked her as VP for a desperation act' \r\n\r\nGuest Lineup\r\nRichard Grenell - Former Director of Communications &amp; Public Diplomacy for the United States Ambassador to the United Nations\r\nCarly Fiorina - Cruz's vice presidential running mate\r\nPaul Manafort - Trump's campaign strategist\r\nTim Wildmon - President, American Family Association\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObama First President Not to See Single Year of 3% Growth\r\n\r\nThe rate of real economic growth is the single greatest determinate of both America's strength as a nation and the well-being of the American people.\r\n\r\nTrump could amass most primary votes in GOP history\r\n\r\nDonald Trump will likely wind up winning the most primary votes of any GOP presidential candidate in modern history, the author of the influential Smart Politics blog told The Post on Wednesday.\r\n\r\n\r\nCBS: Trump can beat Clinton\r\n\r\nHow would Donald Trump fare in a general election against Hillary Clinton? The conventional wisdom is that he wouldn't stand a chance. The GOP is divided. His campaign, despite a recent spate of landslide primary wins, appears to have its own civil war going on. His favorability numbers are at historic lows for a nominee.\r\n\r\n\r\nReally Amazing  - Clinton: An Insider Surviving in Year of the Outsider\r\nIn an election defined by anti-establishment energy and anger, the two parties are now diverging as Republicans fully embrace an outsider as their presidential nominee and Democrats line up behind a quintessential insider.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clinton Pivot Begins\r\nWant to know which way America's political winds are blowing? When Bill Clinton speaks, listen.\r\nTalking in Spokane last month about the U.S. economy, the former president mentioned &quot;the awful legacy of the last eight years.&quot; In Indianapolis Tuesday, Mr. Clinton let the same cat out of the bag:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead it or Weep\r\nHow Trump Can Win the Black Vote to Win the Election\r\nRoger L. Simon - PJ Media\r\nIn the welter of cable commentary over Donald Trump's overwhelming victories in the so-called &quot;Acela primary&quot; Tuesday, among the most startling was an aside by CNN's Van Jones that Trump could win the election if he got just 25% of the black vote. Now this didn't make the African-American activist who co-founded and is the current president of Dream Corps, a &quot;social justice accelerator,&quot; particularly happy. Nor did or does it please BET's Tavis Smiley, who has made similar mention of Trump's possible inroads in the black community. But it's true.\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ingraham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:370034e37e88cafefd8a47c00a71c2ed4bd2df8b","amp;dn":"The-Laura-Ingraham-Show-Podcast+April+28%2C+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"370034e37e88cafefd8a47c00a71c2ed4bd2df8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,0,52,227,126,136,202,254,253,138,71,192,10,113,194,237,75,210,223,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
