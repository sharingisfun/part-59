It includes information about properties, occurrence and technological applications of citric acid and inorganic citrates. Phase equilibria - melting, freezing, boiling, vapour pressures, solubilities of citric acid in water, organic solvents and ternary systems are presented, correlated, and analyzed. Dynamic properties - viscosities, diffusion coefficients, electrical conductivities and surface tensions are examined. Mathematical representations of citric acid dissociation, in electrolyte solutions and in buffers are discussed. Citric acid chemistry - syntheses of citric acid, neutralization, degradation, oxidation, esterification, formation of anhydrides, amides and citrate-based siderophores is reviewed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1ea28949e563693e65c7efbfc0ac02bbd7e7066","amp;dn":"Citric+Acid+-+Alexander+Apelblat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1ea28949e563693e65c7efbfc0ac02bbd7e7066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,234,40,148,158,86,54,147,230,92,126,251,252,10,192,43,189,126,112,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
