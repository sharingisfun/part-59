Neto (saxes), Dennis GonzÃ¡lez\r\n(trumpet, voice), Ernesto Rodrigues (viola), Guilherme Rodrigues (cello, radio)\r\nand Mark Sanders (drums). The only thing that puzzles me is the rather\r\npreposterous theory about surprise and fear in jazz expressed by a Davide\r\nSparti in the inside leaflet and, for good measure, rendered incorrectly in\r\nEnglish from the (already incomprehensible) original. But Italy is the country\r\nin which books and movies have a different meaning than in the rest of the\r\nworld due to the hard-to-believe incompetence of translators, so no big news\r\nhere. Instruments exists, thank god, to deliver us from words and this\r\nparticular project sounds great: strong, determined, both muscularly affirmed\r\nand barely whispered, the improvisations suggesting indeed that kind of anxious\r\nfeeling that whatâ€™s unknown and/or unexpected elicit in frail minds. The\r\ntimbral melange is at times exceptional, the corpulence of Neto and GonzÃ¡lez\r\nversus the fascinating meagreness of the Rodrigueses with Sanders acting as a\r\ngifted master of percussive ceremonies. Thereâ€™s no trace of mellifluousness in\r\nthis intriguing crossing of free jazz and EAI dipped in theatrical stir, and\r\nwhich defies the inevitable conventions of unrehearsed music for its large part.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nCreative Sources \nhttp://www.creativesourcesrec.com/reviews/reviews_139.html\r\n\r\nBy Stef \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2009/05/paura-construction-of-fear-creative.html\r\n\r\nPor Rui Eduardo Paes (pt) \nhttp://rep.no.sapo.pt/criticas_A.htm\r\n\r\nPar Julien HÃ©raud (fr)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffa0926dbd60b0b2d2f92dd762b47c4445e4e080","amp;dn":"Paura+-+The+Construction+Of+Fear+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffa0926dbd60b0b2d2f92dd762b47c4445e4e080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,160,146,109,189,96,176,178,210,249,45,215,98,180,124,68,69,228,224,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
