The majority of the songs are from the Marquee Club, in excellent stereo sound quality! All of the other songs are studio versions, except for MY DEATH. REBEL REBEL and GOLDEN YEARS are so called &quot;dry mixes&quot; made for Top Of The Pops. DODO is a recording with Bowie and Lulu on vocals. The three YOUNG AMERICANS songs are alternative studio takes. As you can see above, lots of different colour variations were released. A nice and interesting disc!&quot;\r\n\r\nThis was my very first silver BowieBoot I bought. (and I bought only a few afterwards, but not because I did not like this one a lot Wink) For your enjoyment served as an &quot;xAct cd-paranoid&quot;-rip.\r\n\r\nInfo: Comments taken from bassman's site: Bonus: colour picture discs, 100 in green, 450 in red, 200 in gold and 100 in green and orange - (this rip was from a golden edition)\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\nThe Music Hall, Boston on 10 January 1972\r\n01 - My Death\r\n\r\nNBC Midnight Special at the Marquee, London on 18-20 October 1973\r\n02 - Sorrow\r\n03 - Time\r\n04 - Everything's Alright\r\n05 - Space Oddity\r\n06 - I Can't Explain\r\n07 - The Jean Genie\r\n08 - 1984/Dodo\r\n\r\nWith Marianne Faithfull\r\n09 - I Got You Babe\r\n\r\nBBC Version: Special Dry Mix made for Top of the Pops broadcast in 1974\r\n10 - Rebel Rebel\r\n\r\nWith Lulu, original full length version recorded in late 1973\r\n11 - Dodo\r\n\r\nYoung Americans recording sessions in 1975\r\n12 - Can You Hear Me?\r\n13 - Right\r\n14 - Somebody Up There Likes Me\r\n\r\nBBC Version: Another Dry Mix made for Top of the Pops in 1975\r\n15 - Golden Years","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00cc3061fbcc03696d6e442677db3f4070ab40c4","amp;dn":"David+Bowie+-+Absolutely+Rare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00cc3061fbcc03696d6e442677db3f4070ab40c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,204,48,97,251,204,3,105,109,110,68,38,119,219,63,64,112,171,64,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
