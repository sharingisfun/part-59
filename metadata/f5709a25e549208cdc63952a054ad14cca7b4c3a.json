From running round the streets like a headless chicken in search of a headline story, to learning what it's like to report from a war zone, Rhod must keep calm, remain impartial and land the scoop if he's to get a job with BBC Wales Today.\r\n\r\n2)  Paranormal Investigator \r\nSceptical Rhod is on the hunt for something he doesn't think exists. Will he find it? Is there anything to find? Will he know it if he finds it anyway? Teaming up with a merry band of ghost hunters, Rhod is expected to host a paranormal evening for the public. Desperate to meet those beyond the grave, Rhod tries to put himself in the scariest situations he can find.\r\n\r\n3)  Rugby Coach \r\nIn 15 years of playing, Rhod may possibly be the only rugby player on earth never to score a point. How will he fare when given the role of coaching a team? After a day at the WRU's school of excellence, he is dumped with Whitland RFC's under-8s, and expected to prepare them for a major tournament. Inspiring and managing the gaggle of energetic youngsters might be his biggest test yet.\r\n\r\n4)  Miner \r\nRhod's hands are silky soft. He's better suited to typing and stroking dogs than operating heavy machinery or sweating it out with intense physical labour. So how will he get on at the UK's largest open cast mine in Merthyr Tydfil, where he'll be tested on everything from driving a 25-tonne truck to handling explosives. Moving onto Europe's deepest mine, Rhod has to learn to work nine kilometres under the North Sea with a foreman who has no time for his whingeing.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/Work-Experience-Series-6-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Work-Experience-Series-6-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/Work-Experience-Series-6-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/Work-Experience-Series-6-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/Work-Experience-Series-6-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/Work-Experience-Series-6-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/58/Work-Experience-Series-6-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ed/Work-Experience-Series-6-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2a/Work-Experience-Series-6-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3282Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~126Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 29 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 4\r\n * Part Size: 713 MB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zf3m1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5709a25e549208cdc63952a054ad14cca7b4c3a","amp;dn":"BBC+Rhod+Gilberts+Work+Experience+Series+6+1of4+Journalist+720p+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5709a25e549208cdc63952a054ad14cca7b4c3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,112,154,37,229,73,32,140,220,99,149,42,5,74,209,76,202,123,76,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
