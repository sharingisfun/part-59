Some tracks have alternate mixes, while &quot;California Love&quot; makes its first proper album appearance after only being available as a single prior","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc0d477821021494035f56a1c039957be66d6f2f","amp;dn":"God+Bless+the+Dead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc0d477821021494035f56a1c039957be66d6f2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,13,71,120,33,2,20,148,3,95,86,161,192,57,149,123,230,109,111,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
