The following morning, the carcass is discovered on the steps of the mosque and the town, already tension-ridden, erupts. Enraged Muslims massacre scores of Hindus and Sikhs, who, in turn, kill every Muslim they can find. Finally, the areaâ€™s British administrators call out the army to prevent further violence. The killings stop but nothing can erase the awful memories from the minds of the survivors, nor will the various communities ever trust one another again.\r\n\r\nThe events described in Tamas are based on true accounts of the riots of 1947 that Sahni was a witness to in Rawalpindi, and this new and sensitive translation by the author himself resurrects chilling memories of the consequences of communalism which are of immense relevance even today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0ac7eac8705bef27b362c1c5dc45cf32c7af0e7","amp;dn":"Tamas+-+Bhisham+Sahni","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0ac7eac8705bef27b362c1c5dc45cf32c7af0e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,172,126,172,135,5,190,242,123,54,44,28,93,196,92,243,44,122,240,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
