Features Blu-spec CD2 format and contains 13 tracks total, including a Japan only bonus track &quot;On My Mind&quot; and two bonus tracks for this edition. Comes with a description and lyrics. Alone in the Universe isn't the first Jeff Lynne album of the 21st century, nor is it the first Electric Light Orchestra of the 21st century. That honor belongs to Zoom, a 2001 comeback that faded quickly into history books, its lack of success blamed in some quarters on Lynne's reluctance to tour. If Jeff didn't want to hit the road, his old bandmate Bev Bevan had no problem constituting a lineup and touring under the name ELO Part II, whose presence somewhat explains why Alone in the Universe is credited to the somewhat convoluted Jeff Lynne's ELO -- a truncation of the band's full name that also assigns credit where it's due, as most listeners associate this majestic post-Abbey Road pop with Lynne alone.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01 - When I Was A Boy\r\n02 - Love And Rain\r\n03 - Dirty To The Bone\r\n04 - When The Night Comes\r\n05 - The Sun Will Shine On You\r\n06 - Ain't It A Drag\r\n07 - All My Life\r\n08 - I'm Leaving You\r\n09 - One Step At A Time\r\n10 - Alone In The Universe\r\n11 - Fault Line {Bonus Track}\r\n12 - Blue {Bonus Track}\r\n13 - On My Mind {Bonus Track} (Japan Only)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62c825d569f60caab9c131e3b092e9485118c071","amp;dn":"Jeff+Lynne%27s+ELO+-+Alone+In+The+Universe+%5BJapan+Blu-spec+CD2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62c825d569f60caab9c131e3b092e9485118c071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,200,37,213,105,246,12,170,185,193,49,227,176,146,233,72,81,24,192,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
