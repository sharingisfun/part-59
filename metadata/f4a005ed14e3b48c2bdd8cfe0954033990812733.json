Instead, they find themselves facing the ghastly Ishmael Izard, son of the fiendish creator of the Doomsday Clock that was once hidden in the walls of Uncle Jonathan's house. Ishmael himself is a cruel and heartless sorcerer, and he is determined to wreak vengeance upon the entire world. Will Lewis and his friends be strong enough to defeat him, or will their fate be decided by their most formidable foe yet?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a005ed14e3b48c2bdd8cfe0954033990812733","amp;dn":"The+Tower+at+the+End+of+the+World+-+Brad+Strickland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4a005ed14e3b48c2bdd8cfe0954033990812733","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,160,5,237,20,227,180,140,43,221,140,254,9,84,3,57,144,129,39,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
