Based on a true story, Krylya tells of the efforts of a famous female fighter pilot from the World War II era to make a life for herself in the postwar era. At 42, the present pales before her memories of the past, and of her true love, now long dead. She is unable to come to terms with her past nor with the present, in which she is the director of a high school and the mother of an adoptive daughter. Her attempts to compensate for her distraction all lie in the direction of appearing authoritative, but the students and her daughter, with the unerring instincts of the young, distrust and despise her. In her distress, she is forced even more deeply into reliving her memories of the only time in which she was truly alive, seeking some kind of answer or resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb8129f25a242fd28b20d70a92063ce2229c5281","amp;dn":"Krylya+aka+Wings+1966+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb8129f25a242fd28b20d70a92063ce2229c5281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,129,41,242,90,36,47,210,139,32,215,10,146,6,60,226,34,156,82,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
