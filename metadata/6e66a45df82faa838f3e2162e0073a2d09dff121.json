For 70,000 marines who fought amid bombings and the Japanese gunfire, the bloody battle for Iwo Jima was more than the turning point for the Allies of World War II; It was also the moment that defined their lives. In this epic, which The New York Times calls an overwhelming spectacle, Clint Eastwood (actor and Oscar-winning director) scours the only and most of all the emotional truth of warfare: soldiers may fight for their country, but they die for his friends. Awarded by critics as a film incredible power and provocative a fantastic achievement (Peter Travers, Rolling Stone), Flags of Our Fathers (nominated for an Oscar for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing) is a powerful story of heroism and bravery deserves to be shared and remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle in Brazil: Flags of Our Fathers\r\nOriginal Title: Flags of Our Fathers\r\nRelease: 2006\r\nGenre: Drama / War\r\nDuration: 135 minutes\r\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418689/\r\n\r\nSize: 4.36 GB\r\nExtension Archives: .ISO\r\nVideo Quality: DVD-R\r\nVideo codec: MPEG-2\r\nAudio codec: AC3 5.1\r\nResolution: 853 x 480\r\nAudio: Portuguese / English\r\nSubtitles: Portuguese / English\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED PLEASE\r\n\r\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e66a45df82faa838f3e2162e0073a2d09dff121","amp;dn":"Flags+of+Our+Fathers+2006+DVDR+R4+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e66a45df82faa838f3e2162e0073a2d09dff121","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,102,164,93,248,47,170,131,143,62,33,98,224,7,58,45,9,223,241,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
