Suicide bombers and other fighters have killed dozens of people since the campaign was launched on Apr. 30.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Pentagon confirmed in March that Anbari, who had a number of other aliases, was killed in a US counterterrorism operation. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter told reporters that Anbari played multiple roles within the so-called caliphate, including having a hand in its â€œexternalâ€ operations, meaning plots targeting the West. Anbari was also a major ideologue within the group. Islamic State supporters have posted more than three dozen of his lectures in Arabic online.

The Talibanâ€™s battles this year have been dedicated to Mullah Omar, the groupâ€™s first emir, who died in 2013. In January, the Islamic State named its quest to capture more territory in Libya after Sheikh Abdul Mugirah al Qahtani, who led the â€œcaliphateâ€™sâ€ men in the North African nation until his demise late last year.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Islamic State has promoted â€œThe Battle of Abu Ali Al Anbariâ€ across its many propaganda outlets. Al Bayan Radio, which streams content and also produces a daily newsletter, has listed several operations as part of the campaign. Other jihadist media outfits have documented additional attacks.\r\n \nhttp://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/05/series-of-deadly-operations-named-after-fallen-islamic-state-leader.php\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t\r\n\r\nPhoto: â€œA western youth who appeared in photographs with Isis fighters has been identified as a high-achieving schoolboy who converted to Islam after the early death of his mother in Melbourne.
