But the mysteries she pens are no match for the one her family is about to endureâ€¦\r\n\r\nOne midsummerâ€™s eve, after a beautiful party drawing hundreds of guests to the estate has ended, the Edevanes discover that their youngest child, eleven-month-old Theo, has vanished without a trace. What follows is a tragedy that tears the family apart in ways they never imagined.\r\n\r\nDecades later, Alice is living in London, having enjoyed a long successful career as an author. Theoâ€™s case has never been solved, though Alice still harbors a suspicion as to the culprit. Miles away, Sadie Sparrow, a young detective in the London police force, is staying at her grandfatherâ€™s house in Cornwall. While out walking one day, she stumbles upon the old estateâ€”now crumbling and covered with vines, clearly abandoned long ago. Her curiosity is sparked, setting off a series of events that will bring her and Alice together and reveal shocking truths about a past long gone...yet more present than ever.\r\n\r\nA lush, atmospheric tale of intertwined destinies, this latest novel from a masterful storyteller is an enthralling, thoroughly satisfying read.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddad04d64237cfc2e701d7d76de0789f8740995e","amp;dn":"The+Lake+House+-+Kate+Morton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddad04d64237cfc2e701d7d76de0789f8740995e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,173,4,214,66,55,207,194,231,1,215,215,109,224,120,159,135,64,153,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
