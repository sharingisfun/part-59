The set features some of the world's most renowned axemen. Performers include Hank Marvin, The Crickets, Brian May, Theresa Anderson, Albert Lee, Mike Rutherford &amp; Paul Carrack, Gary Moore, Jasmine, Steve Rodgers, Jamie Cullum, Amy Winehouse, Paul Rodgers, Joe Walsh, Phil Manzenera, Dave Gilmour, and Ronnie Wood. Bonus features include Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy promo spot, and interviews with The Crickets, Moore, The Shadows, Rutherford, Walsh, Paul Rodgers, May, Andy Fairweather-Low, and Lee.\r\n\r\nWith its trademark contoured body, twin cutaways, and two-toned sunburst finish, the legendary Fender Stratocaster produces a peerless sound that has earned the instrument a permanent spot in the annals of electric guitar history. The distinctive Strat was invented by Leo Fender in 1954, but it was Jimi Hendrix's preference for the guitar during the 1960s that solidified its popularity and made it the instrument of choice for generations of rock's leading guitarists, including Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Dick Dale, and many others. THE STRAT PACK celebrates the 50th anniversary of the storied instrument with a concert recorded at London's Wembley Arena in September of 2004, featuring the star-studded lineup of Joe Walsh, David Gilmour, Brian May, Paul Rodgers, Ron Wood, Hank Marvin, The Crickets, Albert Lee, Gary Moore, Mike Rutherford, Paul Carrack, Phil Manzanera, Amy Winehouse, Jamie Cullum, and Theresa Andersson.\r\n  \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1399097/\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\n   1. &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;\r\n   2. &quot;Maybe Baby&quot;\r\n   3. &quot;I Fought the Law&quot;\r\n   4. &quot;Oh Boy&quot;\r\n   5. &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot;\r\n          * Tracks 1-5 performed by The Crickets, Albert Lee &amp; Brian May.\r\n   6. &quot;The Rise and Fall of Flingel Bunt&quot;\r\n   7. &quot;Sleepwalk&quot;\r\n   8. &quot;Apache&quot;\r\n          * Tracks 6-8 performed by Hank Marvin &amp; Ben Marvin.\r\n   9. &quot;I'm On My Way&quot;\r\n          * Performed by Theresa Andersson.\r\n  10. &quot;Country Boy&quot;\r\n          * Performed by Albert Lee &amp; Theresa Andersson.\r\n  11. &quot;How Long?&quot;\r\n  12. &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; with Andy Fairweather-Low\r\n  13. &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; with Andy Fairweather-Low\r\n  14. &quot;I Can't Dance&quot;\r\n          * Tracks 11-14 performed by Mike Rutherford &amp; Paul Carrack.\r\n  15. &quot;Red House&quot;\r\n          * Performed by Gary Moore.\r\n  16. &quot;Angel&quot;\r\n          * Performed by Jamie Cullum\r\n  17. &quot;Take The Box&quot;\r\n  18. &quot;Stronger Than Me&quot;\r\n          * Tracks 17-18 performed by Amy Winehouse.\r\n  19. &quot;Muddy Waters Blues&quot;\r\n          * Performed by Paul Rodgers.\r\n  20. &quot;Drinking&quot;\r\n          * Performed by Paul Rodgers, Steve Rodgers &amp; Jasmine Rodgers.\r\n  21. &quot;All Right Now&quot;\r\n          * Performed by Paul Rodgers &amp; Brian May.\r\n  22. &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot;\r\n          * Performed by Paul Rodgers &amp; Joe Walsh.\r\n  23. &quot;Funk 49&quot;\r\n  24. &quot;Life's Been Good&quot;\r\n  25. &quot;Life In The Fast Lane&quot;\r\n  26. &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;\r\n          * Tracks 23-26 performed by Joe Walsh.\r\n  27. &quot;6PM&quot; (Phil Manzanera)\r\n          * Performed by Phil Manzanera.\r\n  28. &quot;Marooned&quot;\r\n  29. &quot;Coming Back to Life&quot;\r\n  30. &quot;Sorrow&quot;\r\n          * Tracks 28-30 performed by David Gilmour.\r\n  31. &quot;Ooh La La&quot;\r\n          * Performed by Ronnie Wood.\r\n  32. &quot;Stay With Me&quot;\r\n          * Performed by all the Cast except Hank and Ben Marvin.\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\n    * Joe Walsh: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * David Gilmour: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Brian May: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Paul Rodgers: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Ronnie Wood: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Hank Marvin: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * The Crickets: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Albert Lee: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Gary Moore: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Mike Rutherford: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Paul Carrack: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Phil Manzanera: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Amy Winehouse: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Jamie Cullum: Keyboard, vocals\r\n    * Theresa Andersson: Guitar, vocals\r\n    * Annie Clements: Bass Guitar\r\n\r\nSupport band\r\n\r\n    * Phil Palmer: Guitar, backing vocals\r\n    * Pino Palladino: Bass guitar, backing vocals\r\n    * Paul &quot;Wix&quot; Wickens: Keyboards\r\n    * Ian Thomas: Drums &amp; percussion\r\n\r\n\r\nVenue\r\n\r\n    * Wembley Arena","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e4a51ba807a6ca59457c2d7e135d7f83cdb0d9e","amp;dn":"The+StratPack+-+50th+Stratocaster+Birthday+Party","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e4a51ba807a6ca59457c2d7e135d7f83cdb0d9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,74,81,186,128,122,108,165,148,87,194,215,225,53,215,248,60,219,13,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
