It's a coherent, emotional journey through Pink Floyd's catalog.&quot;\r\n\r\nDarlington began following Pink Floyd's work after hearing The Wall at the age of 13 and he saw the band live for the first time in 1987 during the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. &quot;Since then, he has seen the band in different incarnations, after its split, and including its 2005 reunion.&quot;\r\nPink Floyd saxophonist and rhythm guitar player Scott Page, during a surprise guest performance with Brit Floyd in 2015.\r\n\r\nRegarding his growing up listening to the band, Darlington stated: &quot;I definitely listened to Pink Floyd. I remember Another Brick In The Wall being No. 1 in the UK. It was December 1979. Probably my first memory of Pink Floyd. Then I actually heard The Wall album in its entirety and that's what particularly drew me to Pink Floyd about the age of 12 or 13. I was fascinated by the record that told a story, and all these sound effects linking songs together, and also the wonderful guitar work. I was already learning to play guitar and I wanted to learn to play some of these wonderful guitar solos. That was my introduction to Pink Floyd. I was a fan from quite an early age.&quot;\r\n    \r\nRELEASE YEARS: 2011-2016\r\n    \r\nCOUNTRY: United Kingdom\r\n    \r\nSTYLE: Progressive Rock\r\n    \r\nDURATION:\t9:40:08\r\n    \r\nFORMAT: MP3\r\n    \r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps\r\n    \r\nSite:\tbritfloyd.com\r\n\r\n \r\n    \r\nSize: 1 GB (Files: 112)\r\n    \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n2011 - Live at Liverpool Echo Arena (02:12:41)\r\n\r\nDisc One (01:03:32)\r\n\r\nDisc Two (01:09:09)\r\n\r\n2011 - The Pink Floyd Tribute Show (DVD-rip) (02:19:38)\r\n\r\nDisc One (00:59:07)\r\n\r\nDisc Two (01:20:31)\r\n\r\n2014 - Live at Red Rocks (02:34:22)\r\n\r\nDisc One (01:14:24)\r\n\r\nDisc Two (01:19:58)\r\n\r\n2016 - Space and Time Live in Amsterdam (02:33:27)\r\n\r\nDisc One (01:17:02)\r\n\r\nDisc Two (01:16:24)\r\n\r\nClick files to see all track titles\r\n\r\nBand members\r\n\r\nVarious musicians have played in Brit Floyd since its inception in 2011.
