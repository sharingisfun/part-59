Check my account for more classic bootlegs.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy, share with friends and please seed :)\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Bowie - 9510-16 - Denver\r\n\r\nLive at the McNichols Arena, Denver, CO, USA on 16th October 1995\r\n\r\nFrom an old and dusted archive.\r\n\r\nAudio source: Audience recording\r\nLinage: AUD(DAT/CLONE) ---&gt; CDR ---&gt; WAV ---&gt; FLAC 8 ---&gt; MWP\r\nNumber of discs: 2\r\nArtwork: none\r\nTotal running time: 73m 12s / 24m 00s\r\n\r\nInfo: Again a special requested.\r\n\r\nThis recording is sourced from DAT clone and includes the NIN/Bowie and Bowie sets. The sound\r\nquality of this set is (again) pretty good, but lacks some bass. Bowie is in very good mood, \r\ngiving a very decent performance - a good setlist as well.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is the same source as &quot;They're Winning Next Door&quot;, which appeared a couple\r\nof years after I got this (nameless) set.\r\n\r\nAs always, enjoy it!  \r\n\r\nTracklisting (disc one):\r\n01. Subterraneans / Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (NIN/Bowie)\r\n02. Reptile (NIN/Bowie)\r\n03. Hallo Spaceboy (NIN/Bowie)\r\n04. Hurt (NIN/Bowie)\r\n05. Look Back in Anger (Bowie)\r\n06. I'm Deranged (Bowie)\r\n07. The Hearts Filthy Lesson (Bowie)\r\n08. The Voyeur of Utter Destruction (As Beauty) (Bowie)\r\n09. I Have Not Been to Oxford Town (Bowie)\r\n10. Outside (Bowie)\r\n11.
