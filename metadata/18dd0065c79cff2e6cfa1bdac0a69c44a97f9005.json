The name of the show is a play on &quot;tailspin&quot;, the rapid descent of an aircraft in a steep spiral. The two words in the show's name, tale and spin, are a way to describe telling a story. The show is one of the nine Disney Afternoon shows to use established Disney characters as the main characters, with the others being Darkwing Duck, DuckTales, Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers, Goof Troop, Bonkers, Quack Pack, Aladdin and Timon &amp; Pumbaa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18dd0065c79cff2e6cfa1bdac0a69c44a97f9005","amp;dn":"TaleSpin+Complete+Series+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18dd0065c79cff2e6cfa1bdac0a69c44a97f9005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,221,0,101,199,156,255,46,108,250,27,218,192,166,156,68,169,127,144,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
