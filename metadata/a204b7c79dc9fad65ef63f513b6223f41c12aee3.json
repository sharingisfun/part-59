Pittsburgh Tribune Review @larambrownphd. George Washington University.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Donald Trump has dominated the political discussion for the better part of the last year. While I would prefer to focus on my work in the U.S. Senate, and on my own campaign for reelection, there is an unlimited interest in all-things Trump, so I'll offer a few thoughts about the presidential race.\r\n\r\nâ€œAt the beginning of the primary process, I endorsed Marco Rubio for president. I felt then, and still do, that Rubio possessed the best combination of policy knowledge, dedication to conservative principles, and an inspiring vision to successfully lead our country in these troubled times. I regret that he did not prevail. When the Pennsylvania primary came along last month, I made clear whom I voted for, and it was not Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nâ€œTrump was not my first, second, or third choice. I object to much in his manner and his policies. His vulgarity, particularly toward women, is appalling. His lack of appreciation for Constitutional limits on executive powers is deeply concerning. I disagree with his proposals to ban Muslims, to give government more eminent domain powers, to be neutral between Israel and its enemies, and several others. In short, I find his candidacy highly problematicâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/20160508_Commentary__Advice_to_Trump__Seek_to_unite_and_listen_more.html#UGqq7gslKwGdFmSq.99\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t\r\n \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a204b7c79dc9fad65ef63f513b6223f41c12aee3","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Battleground+TRUMP+HRC.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a204b7c79dc9fad65ef63f513b6223f41c12aee3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,4,183,199,157,201,250,214,94,246,63,81,59,98,35,244,28,18,174,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
