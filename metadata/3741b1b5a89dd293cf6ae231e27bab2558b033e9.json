Off grid, Nancy and Jim face challenges during an ambitious cabin build.\r\n\r\n2)  Eye of the Storm \r\nIn the woods, Jim and Nancy James challenge a wannabe off-grid couple; and Jennifer Hawks tries to find a missing settler. Elsewhere, the delivery of a heavy load proves to be a struggle.\r\n\r\n3)  Night from Hell \r\nAfter an accident, veteran off-gridder Jim James attempts to reach the hospital by train. But obstacles may put him in jeopardy. Elsewhere, the freight crew struggle to open up a port in lockdown.\r\n\r\n4)  The Dead Zone \r\nA communications shutdown leaves a train hauling the biggest load ever moved on the Alaska Railroad hurtling towards a &quot;dead zone&quot;; and off-grid homesteaders tackle the challenge of living off the land in very different ways.\r\n\r\n5)  Mountain Hell \r\nThe freight train battles north to make a crucial delivery, heading to the highest point on the Alaska Railroad; and off-the-grid, things get steamy as old-timers JT and Marvin build a traditional bath.\r\n\r\n6)  Ice Rescue \r\nTempers flare as an extremely heavy train leads to brake problems and a derailment leaves maintenance teams stranded. Off grid, homesteaders narrowly avert a fire but are left without heat.\r\n\r\n7)  Trapped in Ice \r\nA freight crew racing towards Anchorage encounter an icy challenge as they dodge intruders on the track. In the wilderness, homesteaders team up to search for an abandoned cabin washed down stream and trapped in ice.\r\n\r\n8)  Meltdown \r\nThe spring thaw puts the railroad into meltdown mode; and a freight train is stalled on the infamously high Hurricane Gulch.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/db/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/31/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5f/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bc/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6f/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/67/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e9/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bc/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e9/Railroad-Alaska-Season-3-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3162 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 8\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 961 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.tv.com/shows/railroad-alaska/\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Railroad%20Alaska%3A%20Season%201 \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Railroad%20Alaska%3A%20Season%202","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3741b1b5a89dd293cf6ae231e27bab2558b033e9","amp;dn":"Railroad+Alaska+Series+3+7of8+Trapped+in+Ice+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3741b1b5a89dd293cf6ae231e27bab2558b033e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,65,177,181,168,157,210,147,207,106,226,49,226,123,171,37,88,176,51,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
