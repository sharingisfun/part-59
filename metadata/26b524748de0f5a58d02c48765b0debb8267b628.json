The resulting album, Vs., featured a rawer and more aggressive sound compared with the band's previous release. It was the band's first collaboration with producer Brendan O'Brien.\r\nPearl Jam decided to scale back its commercial efforts for Vs., including declining to produce music videos for any of the albumâ€™s singles. Upon its release, Vs. set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week, a record it held for five years. Vs. occupied the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart for five weeks, the longest duration for a Pearl Jam album. The album has been certified seven times platinum by the RIAA in the United States.\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\nGo\r\nAnimal\r\nDaughter\r\nGlorified G\r\nDissident\r\nW.M.A.\r\nBlood\r\nRearviewmirror\r\nRats\r\nElderly Woman Behind the Counter In a Small Town\r\nLeash\r\nIndifference\r\nHold On (Bonus Track)\r\nCready Stomp (Studio Outtake)\r\nCrazy Mary (Bonus Track)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b524748de0f5a58d02c48765b0debb8267b628","amp;dn":"Vs.+%28Expanded+Edition%29+-+Pearl+Jam+%5B1993%2C+m4a%2C+HQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26b524748de0f5a58d02c48765b0debb8267b628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,181,36,116,141,224,245,165,141,2,196,135,101,176,222,187,130,103,182,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
