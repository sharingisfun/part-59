I had one job left to do. After that, I'd finally be free of that bastard crime boss. I'm used to getting what I wantâ€”nothing has ever stopped me. And then I met Sloan. Beautiful... sexy... and a hell of a sassy mouth. She makes me ache in a way no one ever has. She's also the sister of the man I need to take down. How did my luck get so bad? My last job has become something much more complicated. I should stick to the plan, but I can't keep my hands off of her wicked curves. Can I finish this job and keep Sloan? Or will I lose her forever when she finds out the truth? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n                          Visit us for more Awesome ebooks             \r\n\r\n                               http://booksdeity.com/\r\n \r\n                         **********************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db827593cece7b345aec0ac86709c00a98e28600","amp;dn":"Sticky+by+Julia+Swift+%7BBooksDeityTEAM%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db827593cece7b345aec0ac86709c00a98e28600","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,130,117,147,206,206,123,52,90,236,10,200,103,9,192,10,152,226,134,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
