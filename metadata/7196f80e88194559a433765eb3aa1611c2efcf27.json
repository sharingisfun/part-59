The Castawayâ€™s War reads like a thriller, proving again that true history has a punch that few novelists ever achieve.â€â€”Alan Furst, bestselling author of Dark Star and Night Soldiers\r\n\r\nâ€œStephen Harding has done it again! He has somehow found a truly extraordinary story from World War II that has all the elements of a Hollywood thriller or adventure movie, and yet is true in every regard. Weâ€™re all familiar with the stories of sole Japanese who stayed in obscure island jungles fighting on after the peace, but here is its exact mirror image: an American who fought on during wartime on an island from which he had no hope of escape. Unbroken meets The Sands of Iwo Jima.â€â€”Andrew Roberts, author of Napoleon and The Storm of War\r\n\r\nâ€œStephen Harding pulls back the jungle canopy on Arundel Island to uncover a riveting story of courage and resilience from World War II. The Castawayâ€™s War weaves together meticulous research and gripping storytelling to bring alive a story that transcends the war. At its heart, this is a book about finding the inner strength to battle on.â€â€”Brian Murphy, author of 81 Days below Zero\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7196f80e88194559a433765eb3aa1611c2efcf27","amp;dn":"Castaways-War-One-Mans-Battle-Imperial-Japan.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7196f80e88194559a433765eb3aa1611c2efcf27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,150,248,14,136,25,69,89,164,51,118,94,179,170,22,17,194,239,207,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
