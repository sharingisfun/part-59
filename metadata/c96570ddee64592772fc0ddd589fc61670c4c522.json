Rahman was involved in the assassination of National Directorate of Security Deputy Director Dr. Abdullah Laghmani on Sept. 2, 2009. Laghmani was one of 23 Afghans killed in a suicide attack inside a mosque in the city of Mehtarlam, the capital of Laghman province. The NDS captured Rahman and three associates in December 2009, and was described as a Taliban commander in the province. Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders often are members of both groups.\r\n\r\nThe Afghan government has indicated that it would continue to execute members of the Taliban and allied groups. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid responded by threatening agencies involved in the executions.\r\n\r\nâ€œFrom now onwards, #Allah willing, the #Mujahideen shall make all enemy bodies involved in martyring Mujahideen inmates as their top priority during military planning,â€ Mujahid said. â€œThey will not be allowed to breathe peacefully nor will they ever be able to feel security.â€â€¦â€\r\n \nhttp://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/05/taliban-claims-to-have-thousands-of-fully-armed-martyrdom-seekers.php\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c96570ddee64592772fc0ddd589fc61670c4c522","amp;dn":"Taliban+Martryr+Bombers+John+Batchelor.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c96570ddee64592772fc0ddd589fc61670c4c522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,101,112,221,238,100,89,39,114,252,13,221,88,159,198,22,112,196,197,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
