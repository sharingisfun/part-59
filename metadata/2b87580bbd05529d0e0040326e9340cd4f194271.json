Episode 14 actually is the last episode of series 2, if you want to watch them in order. \r\n\r\nThis was one of my favourites when I was a kid and I couldn't get it on torrent anywhere. I have taken this off YouTube as my TV doesn't get on with the website. I have uploaded it just in case anyone is on the same boat. \r\n\r\nThis is my first torrent, so and observations good/bad would be appreciated","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b87580bbd05529d0e0040326e9340cd4f194271","amp;dn":"Project+UFO+1978+-+1979+%28Project+Bluebook%29+TV+Series+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b87580bbd05529d0e0040326e9340cd4f194271","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,135,88,11,189,5,82,157,14,0,64,50,110,147,64,205,79,25,66,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
