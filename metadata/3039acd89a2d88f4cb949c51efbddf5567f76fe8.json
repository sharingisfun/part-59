It's far too cold and wet to play outside- but don't worry- Madeline is here! There are lots of fun things to do in Madeline's room. You can make a mask, create a silly story, paint a masterpiece, and more! Skills Covered: Reading Shapes, Parts of Speech, Matching, Counting, and Science &amp; Nature.\r\n\r\nRipped: Trial extras (e.g. demos for Madeline Classroom Companion and the like) and that dreaded AOL suite to which nobody cares about.\r\n\r\nInstall notes\r\nJust install the game and run, nothing much. It works on Windows 10, too, which is a good thing as most parents, teachers, and those who are just looking for a piece of childhood nostalgia are finding it a real pain in the rear to install and run 90s-era children's educational games on modern rigs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3039acd89a2d88f4cb949c51efbddf5567f76fe8","amp;dn":"Madeline+Rainy+Day+Activities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3039acd89a2d88f4cb949c51efbddf5567f76fe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,57,172,216,154,45,136,244,203,148,156,81,239,189,223,85,103,247,111,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
