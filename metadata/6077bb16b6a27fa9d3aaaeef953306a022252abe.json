I was told to separate out the emotional punk rock and share it with my friends and the world. These aren't super high quality files and some of it is poorly organized. Some of it doesn't even really fit the genre but I felt compelled enough to include em, so there you go.\r\n\r\nHere's screenshots of the folders therein: http://imgur.com/a/faXNM (ignore the repeats in the &quot;The&quot; section; I cleaned those up)\r\n\r\nI tried to add a list of favorites but I realized I would be writing waaay too much on here. So here's a top 16 and then a near random assortment of things I think people should check out. I figure everyone already knows Orchid or City of Caterpillar, so i tried to include things people might otherwise overlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOP 16 (in no order)\r\n1 Tiny Hawks\r\n2 Florence and Libby\r\n3 Meneguar\r\n4 Four Hundred Years\r\n5 Sleepytime Trio\r\n6 Straight, No Chaser\r\n7 Evergreen(KY)\r\n8 The Farewell Bend \r\n9 Tristeza (tracks are out of order, sorry)\r\n10 Shotmaker\r\n11 Pirouette\r\n12 Gregor Samsa\r\n13 The Clippers\r\n14 The Caution Children\r\n15 please inform the captain this is a hijack\r\n16 Harrison Bergeron\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLEEPER BANGERZ\r\n1994!\r\nAbout a Million\r\nApe Up!\r\nAsobi Seksu\r\nBaader Brains\r\nBright Eyes &amp; Neva Dinova\r\nCassilis\r\nCbend\r\nChauncey Gardiner\r\nCombatwoundedveteran\r\nCurl Up &amp; Die\r\nDamezumari (esp This Day from Hitherandthithering Waters of)\r\nDeath to False Screamo (found in Compilations folder)\r\nEkkaia\r\nExasperation Missionary\r\nHoover\r\nIda Sessions\r\nJune of 44\r\nKhonnor\r\nKayo Dot (Choirs of the Eye)\r\nKidcrash (jokes)\r\nLungfish\r\nMake Me\r\nMaximilian Colby\r\nMy Favorite Citizen\r\nMy Heart to Joy\r\nNation of Ulysses\r\nNative Nod\r\nOutclassed\r\nPatrick Wolf\r\nPhoenix Bodies\r\nPortraits of Past\r\nPygmy Lush (old friends)\r\nRilo Kiley\r\nRobot Ate Me\r\nRosetta (galilean satellites combined)\r\nSharks Keep Moving\r\nSinaloa\r\nSparklehorse\r\nSpent\r\nSwarrrm\r\nSwedes\r\nTeeth of Mammals\r\nTen in the Swear Jar\r\nThanksgiving\r\nThe Books\r\nThe Candyland Car Crash\r\nThe Caution Children\r\nThe Jesus Lizard\r\nThe Jim Yoshii Pile-up\r\nThe Summer We Went West\r\nToe\r\nTwelve Hour Turn\r\nVersoma\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso let it be known that Baffled on the Seventh Floor by The Candyland Carcrash is officially the best Emo song ever written and Straight, No Chaser was the best band in the powerviolence/screamo/whatever subgenre.
