For by tying all of these disparate investigations together so thoroughly, so pedantically, and with so many extended footnotesâ€”and by tracking down Western copies of documents that vanished from Russia long agoâ€”the extent of what has always been a murky story suddenly becomes more clear. . . . [Dawisha] turns a relentless focus on the financial story of Putinâ€™s rise to power: page after page contains the gritty details of criminal operation after criminal operation, including names, dates, and figures. Many of these details had never been put together before.â€ (Anne Applebaum New York Review of Books)\r\n\r\nâ€œA whoâ€™s who of the people on the sanctions lists drawn up by America and the EU. It is also a guide to the crony capitalism that grew out of the nexus of Mr. Putinâ€™s plutocratic interests, his shady past and authoritarian rule.â€ (The Economist)\r\n\r\nâ€œPutinâ€™s Kleptocracy should be on the reading list of anyone who wishes to understand the true nature of Putinâ€™s regime, which, as Dawisha correctly states, is â€˜committed to a life of looting without parallel.â€™â€ (Washington Free Beacon)\r\n\r\nâ€œA rich and exhaustive account of Putin and his regime . . . Among Dawishaâ€™s many contributions to our understanding of post-Soviet politics, this book may be the most significant, as the author combines an analysis of such politics and a biography of Russian president Vladimir Putin in unrivaled detail. . . . The notes in this volume represent one of the finest and most imaginative uses of published source materials that this reviewer has ever seen in a book on post-Soviet politics.â€ (Library Journal (starred review))  https://www youtube. com/watch?v=PUwVrklT6tQ\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6f0c8cb8d3294e35381e838ab307ee99cef93fd","amp;dn":"Putin-Kleptocracy-Who-Owns-Russia.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6f0c8cb8d3294e35381e838ab307ee99cef93fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,240,200,203,141,50,148,227,83,129,232,56,171,48,126,233,156,239,147,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
