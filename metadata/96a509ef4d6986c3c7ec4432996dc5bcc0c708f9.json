O'Brien et al. (AOCS, 2000).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 1893997138\r\n\r\nSince the first edition was introduced, the fats and oils industry has undergone a number of changes and challenges that have prompted the development of new and revised products, technologies, and processing techniques. This second edition provides a more complete coverage of the pertinent subjects in fats and oils technology. At the same time it follows the original objective, i.e., to provide an overview of the fats and oils industry and serve as a starting point for new fats and oils scientists and engineers. This edition has been expanded from 19 to 29 chapters and subdivided into five sections, covering raw materials, processing, quality, applications, and new developments. The material covered in the 16 chapters retained from the first edition has been updated to include the advances in technology and practice. Thirteen new chapters that pertain to new areas of fats and oils technology have been added to supplement the original material","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96a509ef4d6986c3c7ec4432996dc5bcc0c708f9","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Fats+and+Oils+Technology+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96a509ef4d6986c3c7ec4432996dc5bcc0c708f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,165,9,239,77,105,134,195,199,236,68,50,153,109,197,188,192,199,8,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
