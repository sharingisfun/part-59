Gregory Copley, Defense &amp; Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nEast of Suez, the New Great Game Breaks Into the Open\r\n\r\nAnalysis. By Gregory R. Copley, Editor, GIS/Defense &amp; Foreign Affairs. Finally, the great geopolitical rivalry between the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC) and India has broken into the open. It is an ancient rivalry, pre-dating the modern states, and it is played out largely in the trade routes of Africa, the Western Indian Ocean, and the khanates and lands of the Northern Tier: Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Central Asia.\r\n\r\nIndiaâ€™s April 2016 deal to dominate the Iranian port and free zone of Chahbahar [25Â°17â€™31â€N; 60Â°38â€™35â€E], on the Gulf of Oman (Indian Ocean), and Pakistanâ€™s high-profile arrest of an Indian intelligence officer in Pakistani Baluchistan, are tips of the iceberg in this new Great Game. And this time, it is a Great Game played at very close quarters.\r\n\r\nIt was escalated considerably during the build-up of the US-led Coalition war against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan, from 2001 onwards, and it is still being played out there, although Indiaâ€™s main preoccupation during this time was heavily focused on the â€œcontainmentâ€ or break-up of Pakistan. There were two main reasons for this: 1. The emotional animosity to Pakistan based on the 1947 Partition of British India; and 2. (and more importantly) the need to deny the PRC an overland access to the Indian Ocean (and also to deny the PRC the ability to contain India into the sub-continent and deny it access to Central Asia).\r\n\r\nThere should be no distraction by the shibboleth that a nuclear-armed Pakistan poses an existential threat to the existence or security of India. Pakistanâ€™s nuclear forces are logically, and of necessity, built to fulfill a counter-force doctrine; in other words, they are designed to blunt an Indian conventional armored assault across the Punjab plains and across the Rann of Kutch which otherwise (and despite Pakistanâ€™s considerable Army strength) could quickly penetrate and overrun Pakistanâ€™s major cities. Pakistan has no strategic depth. India, on the other hand, has considerable strategic depth, and therefore can utilize its own nuclear forces for counter-city strikes, easily destroying the Pakistani population and command centers. [A Pakistani nuclear strike on Indian cities would do little to diminish Indiaâ€™s dispersed military capabilities.]\r\n\r\nThrough the Coalition war in Afghanistan â€” in which the US depended absolutely on Pakistanâ€™s support and geography â€” India used its intelligence capabilities and US good offices to deploy anti-Pakistani assets inside Afghanistan to target Pakistan from its West. This was, and still is, significant and successful; it has kept Pakistanâ€™s forces preoccupied in the Pakistani north-west and west, and away from the borders with India, especially within Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Azad [or Free] Kashmir, the area which gives the geographic land-bridge between the PRC and Pakistan)â€¦.\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c57cfd42f92fe87db547fa80c68736d118afdc1","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-Battle-for-theIindian-Ocean-Basin.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c57cfd42f92fe87db547fa80c68736d118afdc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,87,207,212,47,146,254,135,219,84,127,168,12,104,115,109,17,138,253,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
