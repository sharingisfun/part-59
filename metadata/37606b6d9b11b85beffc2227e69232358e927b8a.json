The song was released as 2Pac's comeback single after his release from prison in 1995 and was his first single as a Death Row Records artist. This is perhaps 2Pac's best-known song and his most successful, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks (as a double A-side single with &quot;How Do U Want It&quot;) and 5 weeks at number one in New Zealand. The song was nominated for a posthumous Grammy Award as a Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (with Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman) in 1997","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37606b6d9b11b85beffc2227e69232358e927b8a","amp;dn":"California+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37606b6d9b11b85beffc2227e69232358e927b8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,96,107,109,155,17,184,91,239,252,34,39,230,146,50,53,142,146,123,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
