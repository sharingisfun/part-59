In just a few years, it became the leading news magazine in the country. Now, with editions in five languages, it is the most widely-read publication in India-a position it has held for over a decade-with a readership of over 11 million (Source: NRS). The magazineâ€™s leadership is unquestioned; so much so that INDIA TODAY is what Indian journalism is judged by, for its integrity and ability to bring unbiased and incisive perspective to arguably the most dynamic, yet perplexing, region in the world. Breaking news and shaping opinion, it is now a household name and the flagship brand of Indiaâ€™s leading multidimensional media group. We ask the most difficult questions and provide the clearest answers.\r\n\r\nIndia Today â€“ 15 February 2016\r\nEnglish | 122 pages | True PDF | 39 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:052e9e26f8c7c812d8e08214a65bff6cabea718f","amp;dn":"India+Today+%26ndash%3B+15+February+2016%5BThePirateBay%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"052e9e26f8c7c812d8e08214a65bff6cabea718f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,46,158,38,248,199,200,18,216,224,130,20,166,91,255,108,171,234,113,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
