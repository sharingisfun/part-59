Partial differential equations and numerical analysis are used extensively throughout the text, with numerous calculation examples, to help the reader in achieving a working knowledge of computational solidification modeling. The features of this new edition include: â€¢ new chapters on semi-solid and metal matrix composites solidification â€¢ a significantly extended treatment of multiscale modeling of solidification and its applications to commercial alloys â€¢ a survey of new topics such as solidification of multicomponent alloys and molecular dynamic modeling â€¢ new theories, including a theory on oxide bi-films in the treatment of shrinkage problems â€¢ an in-depth treatment of the theoretical aspects of the solidification of the most important commercial alloys including steel, cast iron, aluminum-silicon eutectics, and superalloys â€¢ updated tables of material constants","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:935b800fee2a0a14e8bd904f5426d36a27f55ec2","amp;dn":"Science+and+Engineering+of+Casting+Solidification+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"935b800fee2a0a14e8bd904f5426d36a27f55ec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,91,128,15,238,42,10,20,232,189,144,79,84,38,211,106,39,245,94,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
