The former defense secretary said the president believes that â€œif you ratchet up sanctions, it could cause a war. If you start opposing their interests in Syria, well, that could start a war, too.â€â€¦\r\n \nhttp://freebeacon.com/national-security/obama-policies-toward-hackers-produce-few-results/\r\n\r\n_________\r\n\r\nNext monthâ€™s inauguration of Tsai Ing-wen as president of Taiwan offers a unique opportunity for Washington to address two fraught issues in U.S.-China relations.\r\n\r\nFirst, sending an appropriate high-level American official to Taipei would signal U.S. commitment to the democratic security of Taiwan in the face of Beijingâ€™s intensifying pressure.\r\n\r\nSecond, it would elevate Taiwanâ€™s status as a regional security ally, while using a diplomatic/political tool to respond to Chinaâ€™s increasingly aggressive moves.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping victory of Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party rankles Beijing for good reason. The Taiwanese people soundly rejected deeper political ties with China, let alone any prospect of unification.\r\n\r\nTsai was circumspect in discussing the cross-strait political and security situation during the campaign and in her victory speech. But her noncommittal stance on â€œone Chinaâ€ is unacceptable to Beijing.\r\n\r\nChinaâ€™s 2005 Anti-Secession Law threatens the use of force against Taiwan not only if it declares formal independence but also if â€œpossibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhaustedâ€ â€“ a contingency Beijing may have decided has now arrived. Henry Kissinger warned Taiwan in 2007 that â€œChina will not wait forever.â€ And Xi Jinping said in 2013, â€œthe [Taiwan] issue cannot be passed on from generation to generation.â€\r\n\r\nYet, even the Kuomintang Party under President Ma Ying-jeou said unification could be considered only with a democratic China. But Beijing never seems to grasp that the more it threatens Taiwan, the more it alienates younger generations of Taiwanese. They see how China treats the people of Hong Kong under the â€œone country, two systemsâ€ model Deng Xiaoping offered both societies.\r\n\r\nThe Obama administration should make clear that the Taiwanese people are entitled to determine their relationship with China, without force or coercion from Beijing.\r\n \nhttp://thediplomat.com/2016/04/why-the-us-should-send-biden-to-taiwan/\r\n \nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/05/10/kim-emerges-more-confident-and-powerful-north-koreas-congress/84173972/\r\n \nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/article/435254/donald-trumps-tax-returns-delegates-should-abstain-if-he-wont-release\r\n \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/05/11/trump-created-the-grounds-for-a-contested-convention/?postshare=9691462988209668&amp;tid=ss_tw\r\n\r\nThe John Bathchelor Show \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba8e0564a050c9796a93126f049f44d3d3c24e53","amp;dn":"IRS+Threatens+Trump+John+Batchelor+05112015.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba8e0564a050c9796a93126f049f44d3d3c24e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,142,5,100,160,80,201,121,106,147,18,111,4,159,68,211,211,194,78,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
