Horizon also talks exclusively to his wife and two children as they prepare to wave him goodbye on his voyage to space.\r\n\r\nFrom training in the Soyuz capsule, centrifuges, space station mockups, virtual reality and a huge pool to replicate spacewalks, to dealing with the physical dangers of weightlessness, witnessing his first launch and spending time away from his wife Rebecca and his two sons, this is an intimate portrait and remarkable insight into the world of an astronaut","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08679f31346df2be71f44462a0b73dd7a53a5d60","amp;dn":"Horizon.ake.Special.How.To.Be.An.Astronaut.ENSUB.x265.MPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08679f31346df2be71f44462a0b73dd7a53a5d60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,103,159,49,52,109,242,190,113,244,68,98,160,183,61,215,165,58,93,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
