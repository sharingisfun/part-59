Through a process called Germanization, they were to become the next generation of the Aryan master race in the second phase of the Final Solution.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn the summer of 1942, parents across Nazi-occupied Yugoslavia were required to submit their children to medical checks designed to assess racial purity. One such child, Erika Matko, was nine months old when Nazi doctors declared her fit to be a â€œChild of Hitler.â€ Taken to Germany and placed with politically vetted foster parents, Erika was renamed Ingrid von Oelhafen. Many years later, Ingrid began to uncover the truth of her identity.\r\n\r\nâ€œThough the Nazis destroyed many Lebensborn records, Ingrid unearthed rare documents, including Nuremberg trial testimony about her own abduction. Following the evidence back to her place of birth, Ingrid discovered an even more shocking secret: a woman named Erika Matko, who as an infant had been given to Ingridâ€™s mother as a replacement child.\r\n\r\nâ€œHitlerâ€™s Forgotten Children is both a harrowing personal memoir and a devastating investigation into the awful crimes and monstrous scope of the Lebensborn program.â€\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a977776643d8746d926687c3a9f78d6e854497b4","amp;dn":"John-Batchelo-Hitlers-Forgotten-Kids-Lebensborn.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a977776643d8746d926687c3a9f78d6e854497b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,119,119,102,67,216,116,109,146,102,135,195,169,247,141,110,133,68,151,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
