First you have to download them, after which you can install or delete them, open their file location, hide items or report errors. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the &quot;Tools&quot; menu, you can view hardware information, use a backup and restore system for the drivers, as well as uninstall them. \r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you can select the Interface language, configure proxy settings, set DriverEasy to automatically create a restore point before installing the drivers and view a list of all hidden devices. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe program consumes a moderate-to-high amound of system resources and doesn't include a help file. Overall, it works smoothly, but sometimes it can take a very long while to download a driver. DriverEasy even freezes during downloading tasks. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn some cases, I'm weren't able to install the download items. Also, the demo version allows you to download only one driver at a time. So, I suggest you test DriverEasy for yourself! \r\n\r\n\r\nDriverEasy 4.9.9.1661 â€“ Release Date: 2015.12.16 (Current Version): \r\n\r\n\r\n* Improve Feedback function.\r\n\r\n- Fix minor bugs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b71a8cd8262455fc2f6d789cb3fc9360ca9ba2b","amp;dn":"DriverEasy+4.9.9.1661+%2B+Key+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b71a8cd8262455fc2f6d789cb3fc9360ca9ba2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,113,168,205,130,98,69,95,194,246,215,137,203,63,201,54,12,169,186,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
