On the other hand, religion brings many benefits for which the New Atheists have been unable to provide a viable alternative.\r\n\r\nTaking a tone sympathetic to the views of both religious and atheist readers alike, the Triple Path offers a credible synthesis of modern scientific knowledge and the useful teachings and practices of the world's major religions, making use of the latest scientific research and referencing scores of peer-reviewed academic papers. Most importantly, it collects the most moving words of wisdom of the world's great sacred texts and then updates and adds to them to create a new approach relevant to life today.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the book at TriplePath.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the author: James Kenneth Rogers received a B.A. in International Relations, with honors, from Brigham Young University, a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School, and a Masters of Law in International Law from the University of Cambridge.
