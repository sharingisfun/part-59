But with a top director, an excellent cast and beautiful colour, it is a find worth digging up. Warner Brothers' second movie to be shot in the new, more lifelike process of three-strip Technicolor, the movie tells the true story of the battle between gold miners and farmers in Northern California during the 1870s. George Brent stars as a mining engineer who falls in love with a farmer's daughter, Olivia de Havilland. Claude Rains is her father who disapproves of miners and forbids Brent from courting her. The romantic story, however, is quite secondary to the true and very realistically presented story of the ravages caused by the gold mining industry of that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 632x460, 23.976 fps, 1480 Kbps, 01h34m09s\r\nAudio: MP3, 44100 Hz, stereo, 128 kbps\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, DUAL Audio Tracks English and Spanish\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles English and Russian\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/iiod64w6p/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/e7o3zyn01/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/kwq228iy9/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5mq6v1ng1/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/7d97wj4z5/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ebb6f2162088b9ff4cd7e73ee0ce4494c28b156","amp;dn":"Gold+Is+Where+You+Find+It+%5B1938+-+USA%5D+Technicolor+western","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ebb6f2162088b9ff4cd7e73ee0ce4494c28b156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,187,111,33,98,8,139,159,244,205,126,115,238,12,228,73,76,40,177,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
