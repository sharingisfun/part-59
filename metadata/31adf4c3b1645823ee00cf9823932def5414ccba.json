The recording quality is distant and a bit muffled, as if this came from an amateur, private collector, or bootleg tapes. The recording is certainly not from a sound board or engineered to maximum effect, and there is no other correlating release to be found that suggests this is a reissue. The music, of course, is well played, as these three shared a dynamism few jazz trios can ever claim, and for that reason alone collectors may want this. For those just getting familiar with Peterson's brilliance, it would be an item to pass on in lieu of his many other commercially available recordings. \r\nOne wonders if Peterson actually approved its release...hmmmm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31adf4c3b1645823ee00cf9823932def5414ccba","amp;dn":"The+Oscar+Peterson+Trio+-+Like+Someone+In+Love+%5BFlac%5D%5BTNT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31adf4c3b1645823ee00cf9823932def5414ccba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,173,244,195,177,100,88,35,238,0,207,152,35,147,45,239,84,20,204,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
