A serial killer is out there, his frequency increasing, and they know there is only one agent good enough to crack this case: Special Agent Riley Paige.\r\n\r\nRiley is on paid leave herself, recovering from her encounter with her last serial killer, and, fragile as she is, the FBI is reluctant to tap her brilliant mind. Yet Riley, needing to battle her own demons, comes on board, and her hunt leads her through the disturbing subculture of doll collectors, into the homes of broken families, and into the darkest canals of the killerâ€™s mind. As Riley peels back the layers, she realizes she is up against a killer more twisted than she could have imagined. In a frantic race against time, she finds herself pushed to her limit, her job on the line, her own family in danger, and her fragile psyche collapsing.\r\n..[/color][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://s10.postimg.org/l1kh8y3gp/cooltext1925887515.gif[/img][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53437ed0bcae6cd73a4171f1fa08c449f9b4c5dd","amp;dn":"Once+Gone+Boo1+By+Blake+Pierce+%5BEPUB%5D+%5BDTW%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53437ed0bcae6cd73a4171f1fa08c449f9b4c5dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,67,126,208,188,174,108,215,58,65,113,241,250,8,196,73,249,180,197,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
