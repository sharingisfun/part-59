I had to use 2 different Samsung Smartphones to film this with and it is not the complete show but it is most of it. (2 matches are not included due to having limited battery remaining on my cameras) Also it is only from one angle from where I was sitting and there were a few noisy fans around me talking sometimes but I had no control over them but either way enjoy this show for what it is!!! I did my best video editing job I could do to remove a few places where people stepped in front of the camera or bumped into me but overall its pretty good all things considered.\r\n\r\nStoneCold420 on May 15, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUS Championship match\r\nDean Ambrose\r\nvs\r\nKalisto\r\nvs\r\nRusev with Lana\r\n\r\n\r\nVaudeVillains \r\nAiden English and Simon Gotch \r\nvs\r\nThe New Day\r\nBig E and Xavier Woods\r\n\r\n\r\nTyler Breeze and R-Truth make an appearance (NOT included)\r\n\r\n\r\n(This Match NOT included)\r\nGoldust \r\nvs \r\nFandango \r\n\r\n\r\nBecky Lynch, Paige, Sasha Banks \r\nvs\r\nDana Brooke, Lana, Eva Marie\r\n\r\n\r\nJack Swagger and Titus Oâ€™Neil \r\nvs\r\nSocial Outcasts \r\nBo Dallas and Curtis Axel with Heath Slater\r\n\r\n\r\n(This match NOT included)\r\nViktor\r\nvs\r\nSin Cara \r\n\r\n\r\nBig Show and Kane\r\nvs\r\nBraun Strowman and Erick Rowan\r\n\r\n\r\nEden was the ring announcer\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is SDH release #2,166 for the wrestling fans from a wrestling fan.
