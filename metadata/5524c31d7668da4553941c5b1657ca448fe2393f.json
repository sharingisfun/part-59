From young guys espousing men's rights at Speakers Corner in Hyde Park, to the underground movement of male separatists of MGTOW (or Men Going Their Own Way), Reggie also encounters infamous self-styled pick-up artist Roosh V, who dishes out advice on how to have more sex with women - but doesn't seem to like them very much","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5524c31d7668da4553941c5b1657ca448fe2393f","amp;dn":"Reggie.Yates.Extreme.UK.s01e02.EN.SUB.HEVC.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5524c31d7668da4553941c5b1657ca448fe2393f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,36,195,29,118,104,218,69,83,148,28,91,22,87,202,68,143,226,57,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
