Guns N' Roses were soon to be known as the last mammoth rock entity to come out of LA after selling over 100 million albums. Jon Brewer brings alive never-before-seen video footage of Guns N' Roses in their earliest days as a fledgling band, filmed and meticulously archived over the years by their close friend. They became known as 'the most dangerous band in the world' and retained the title for reasons this film portrays, via interviews with band members and those who were there on, and off, tour. Venture down seedy Sunset Strip to the Whiskey, the Rainbow and the Roxy, all known as 'the Jungle'.\r\n\r\n\r\nGSpot says:\r\nDVD VOB format\r\nMPEG-2Program Stream &lt;&lt; (1 vid, 1 aud)\r\nSys Bitrate 10080 kb/s VBR 6034 kbps I/L TFF\r\nPAL 16:9\r\nAC3 0xbd(0x80):48000Hz 384 kb/s tot.\r\nstereo (2/0) \r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:569aa98ebe3221bb8d4e580d4d18ac38b474e61c","amp;dn":"Guns+N%27+Roses-Most+Dangerous+Band-DVD5-PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"569aa98ebe3221bb8d4e580d4d18ac38b474e61c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,154,169,142,190,50,33,187,141,78,88,13,77,24,172,56,180,116,230,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
