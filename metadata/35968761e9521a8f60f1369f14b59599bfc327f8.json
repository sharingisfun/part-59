Having joined forces last year, Finn Rees and Allan McConnell began experimenting with a variety of instruments, sounds and production techniques, and the results thus far are pretty special. Sitting somewhere between an amalgamation of Disclosure, Hermitude, fellow Tasmanian Akuou and Flying Lotus, their four-track debut EP is as diverse as it is interesting as it is just plain groovy.\r\n \nhttp://pilerats.com/shit-weve-done/close-counters-close-counters-ep/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35968761e9521a8f60f1369f14b59599bfc327f8","amp;dn":"Close+Counters+-+Self+Titled+EP+%282014%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35968761e9521a8f60f1369f14b59599bfc327f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,150,135,97,233,82,26,143,96,241,54,159,20,181,149,153,191,195,39,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
