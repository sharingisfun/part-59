He's intolerant, rude and paranoid. All hell frequently breaks loose as Basil tries to run the hotel, constantly under verbal (and sometime physical) attack from his unhelpful wife Sybil, and hindered by the incompetent, but easy target, Manuel; their Spanish waiter.\r\n\r\nS1, Ep1\r\n\r\nOriginally Aired: 19 Sep. 1975\r\n\r\nA Touch of Class\r\n\r\nBasil is delighted when a member of the aristocracy chooses to stay at the Fawlty Towers, snubbing the normal guests who frequent the hotel. What Basil does not know, however, is that the man is not a Lord but a confidence trickster who attempts to steal his collection of rare coins. As Basil's desperation to keep such an 'upstanding' guest increases, he becomes increasingly tolerant towards the man's behavior, only to have the guest arrested in a police raid on the hotel.\r\n\r\n720x480px @ 1362kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e79167e94e5a58dba48d17266460ad571c9bd746","amp;dn":"Fawlty+Towers+S01E01+A+Touch+of+Class","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e79167e94e5a58dba48d17266460ad571c9bd746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,145,103,233,78,90,88,219,164,141,23,38,100,96,173,87,28,155,215,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
