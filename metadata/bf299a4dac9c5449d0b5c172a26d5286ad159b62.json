The setting is Germany, the people the Kurds. Yilmaz Arslan combines a complex plot about two brothers with scenes of visceral violence as well as a tender picture of caring friendship. His film is both an accusation against racism and neglect and a plea for common humanity and decency.\r\n\r\nBoasting astonishing performances from a largely non-professional cast, Fratricide is an explosive tale of desperate conflict and bloody revenge, a savage, furious, and heartbreaking portrait of raw humanity struggling for safety, for dignity, for survival in the face of violence, exile and the brutal indifference of a society that wants no part of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 624x336, 23.976 fps, 899 Kbps, 01h35m26s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 114 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Turkish audio with Kurdish and German, optional subtitles English, Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ncdwno86f/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4v4c5grb1/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/yyiuxeukd/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/79w7pw7jx/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/d9jytjscd/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf299a4dac9c5449d0b5c172a26d5286ad159b62","amp;dn":"Brudermord+-+Fratricide+%282005+-+Germany%29+Kurdish+refugee+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf299a4dac9c5449d0b5c172a26d5286ad159b62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,41,154,77,172,156,84,73,208,181,193,114,162,109,82,134,173,21,155,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
