Rather than an unwieldy dump of thousands of issues that are meticulously numbered and ordered (and whose filenames screw with modern comic reader parsers), the Chronology is presented as a series of ad-hoc collections with a simple volume ordering. I'll be releasing these in series of 10 volumes a piece.\r\n\r\nAs with previous releases of this chronology, strict chronology order has been followed as close as possible, though some flexibility and &quot;grain of salt&quot; needs to be used for proper interpretation. Books have been culled from a variety of sources and all credit goes to the original scanners/rippers\r\n\r\nNow included in all releases is a copy of the Overview and Roadmap, outlining major events and acting as a starter's guide to Superman's adventures to help new readers find jumping-on points","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a9bb2b82097e0bdb00c32a71f478d2a89d9e90","amp;dn":"Superman+Post-Crisis+Chronology%2C+Volumes+391-400","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a9bb2b82097e0bdb00c32a71f478d2a89d9e90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,169,187,43,130,9,126,11,219,0,195,42,113,244,120,210,168,157,158,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
