(Wiley-Scrivener, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-118-38511-1\r\n\r\nAn excellent, unique, and up-to-date reference book on polyoxymethylene, its compounds, and nanocomposites, specifically dealing with synthesis, characterization, processing, morphology, and applications\r\n\r\nPolyoxymethylene Handbook: Structure, Properties, Applications, and Their Nanocomposites summarizes many of the state-of-the-art technological and research accomplishments in the area of polyoxymethylene (POM). It discusses in length the polymerization and manufacture of polyoxymethylene and various types of additives, as well as the structure and crystallization behavior of POM and its thermal, physical, mechanical, flame retardant, chemical, electrical, and optical properties. The environmental impact of POM is also addressed.\r\n\r\nThe 15 chapters in the handbook are written by prominent researchers from industry, academia, and government/private research laboratories across the globe. Because so few books have ever been published on polyoxymethylene, the handbook is a very valuable reference tool that truly serves as a â€œone stopâ€ resource for readers and users seeking solutions to both fundamental and applied problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f7ba74bdca6f24efd6ca0249649d95cf96900b0","amp;dn":"Polyoxymethylene+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f7ba74bdca6f24efd6ca0249649d95cf96900b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,123,167,75,220,166,242,78,253,108,160,36,150,73,217,92,249,105,0,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
