The text also discusses the molecular beams; the energy flow in polyatomic molecules; and the different properties of molecules in relation to electronical excitation and quasi-electric light scattering. Studies of different chemical reactions are also included.\r\nThe text is recommended for chemists, biochemists, and chemical physicists who want to know more about lasers and its applications to their respective fields. The book will also be helpful for those concerned with the chemical reactions lasers can bring about and for those who want to conduct further studies regarding laser uses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed290b439d85aa55c24fdf22e0344ccd6ebf72e1","amp;dn":"Chemical+and+Biochemical+Applications+of+Lasers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed290b439d85aa55c24fdf22e0344ccd6ebf72e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,41,11,67,157,133,170,85,194,79,223,34,224,52,76,205,110,191,114,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
