The program learns, becomes sentient and begins to behave like a human. When a master computer program, Echelon, takes over America's entire online system, our country is threatened to be brought to its knees. Hacking into DARPA, Echelon gains the ability to manipulate the weather, create earthquakes, and cause a level of destruction unlike anything the country could ever imagine. But how do you stop a computer program when it has control over any and every defense you have?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c45b79896c513b196535521bc77eadd468d96ddf","amp;dn":"Stormageddon+2015+BRRip+X264+AC3-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c45b79896c513b196535521bc77eadd468d96ddf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,91,121,137,108,81,59,25,101,53,82,27,199,126,173,212,104,217,109,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
