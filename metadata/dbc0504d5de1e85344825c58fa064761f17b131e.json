Devastated by the unexpected loss, the students and teachers behaved like Misaki was still alive, leading to a strange presence on the graduation photo. In Spring 1998, 15-year-old KÅichi Sakakibara transfers into Yomiyama's class 3-3, where he meets Mei Misaki, a strange student whom their classmates and teachers seemingly ignore. The class is soon caught up in a strange phenomenon, in which students and their relatives begin to die in mysterious ways. Realizing that these deaths are related to the &quot;Misaki of 1972&quot;, it is up to KÅichi and Mei to discover the cause of these mysterious deaths and figure out how to stop it before it kills them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGenre: Horror, Mystery\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAge Rating: R ( strong violence/ gruesome accidents, and for brief language )\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFile information:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnderwater Video + Audio (jpn) + English Subtitles &amp; Attachments (default) + chapter files\r\n\r\nCBM English Dub audio (default) + English subtitles &amp; attachments\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVideo: H264 10-bit | Japanese | 1920x1080p | 23.9776215 | MKV\r\n\r\nAudio:\r\n\r\n01) MPEG AAC | Japanese | 48000 Hz\r\n\r\n02) MPEG AAC | English | Stereo | 48000 Hz (default)\r\n\r\nSubtitles:\r\n\r\n01) .ASS | English | (Underwater)\r\n\r\n02) .ASS | English | Signs and Songs\r\n\r\n03) .ASS | English | English subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbc0504d5de1e85344825c58fa064761f17b131e","amp;dn":"%5BARRBEE009%5D+Another+%28BD1080p%29%28Dual+Audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbc0504d5de1e85344825c58fa064761f17b131e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,192,80,77,93,225,232,83,68,130,92,88,250,6,71,97,241,123,19,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
