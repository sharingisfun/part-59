Style your notes as you wish. Make your notes bold, italicized, or colorful and organize your content with tables.\r\n\r\n-- Capture anything --\r\nAdd pictures of recipes, your PowerPoint doc or PDF for school, links to your favorite sites, and web articles for future reference. Capture it all in OneNote and add your annotations.\r\n\r\n-- Powerful organization --\r\nOrganize your notes in a way that works best for you. Create, rename, search, sort, color code, and copy pages, sections, and notebooks to organize your content as you'd like. Keep your private notes safe.\r\n\r\n-- Tag it --\r\nEasily tag your notes so they stand out. Track a list of your daily to-dos, flag questions to raise after a meeting, or mark the important points from a lecture.\r\n\r\n-- Think together --\r\nShare your notes with your friends and colleagues, whether it's a party your planning with others or a school project youâ€™re working on with your group.

Keeping chart axes straight have your mood slopin' down? We've got your back. You can now add perfectly crisp lines, polygons, and other geometric miscellanies from the &quot;Insert&quot; menu. \r\n- We spiffied up Search over the holidays and added some new tricks! Now: search all of your OneDrive notebooks, even if they're not on your device; zippier results, so zippy you can search for things you're already reading and *almost* find them quicker; and, as before, see glimpses of notes you haven't written yet. Wait. Not that last one. But the rest!\r\n\r\nHaving trouble? Send feedback in the app by clicking the smiley face at the top right of the app. \r\nHave an idea?
