Ted Cruz (Tex.).\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat happened in Tuesdayâ€™s primaries was not wholly unexpected. Trump was playing on home turf, in states where Republican voters for the most part are less ideologically conservative than in other areas of the country. But as with his victory in New York a week ago, just because something was predicted doesnâ€™t mean it isnâ€™t significant.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhich is why the losers â€” Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who are now in an odd-couple alliance to stop Trump â€” did what losing candidates have done throughout this long primary season. They tried to make the best case they could that the battles ahead, not those just concluded, are the ones that really count. They are left to cling to no more than that.\r\n \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/indiana-looms-large-for-cruzs-slender-hopes-after-trump-sweeps-northeast/2016/04/26/e0c111f4-0b2d-11e6-8ab8-9ad050f76d7d_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_take-1025pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:149fda704c3970d541a05af70cc83f8391197cbb","amp;dn":"JohnBatchelor-Indiana-Waterloo-NEVER-TRUMP.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"149fda704c3970d541a05af70cc83f8391197cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,159,218,112,76,57,112,213,65,160,90,247,12,200,63,131,145,25,124,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
