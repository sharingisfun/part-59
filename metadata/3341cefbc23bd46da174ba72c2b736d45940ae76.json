How, when, why? No one knows this. Such rarities only in v 0.9\r\n\r\nits a typical arcade-type jump from platform to platform, and do not fall, from the first-person view.\r\nThe game places is quite difficult, because Iâ€™ve done Iâ€™ve done 2 savepointy that one could quickly get back on the route. savepoint is marked with a pedestal with a red button (just stand next to this button to trigger)\r\n\r\nThe problem causes only menu. Something was wrong with blueprintach and is not working corretly. You have to click first somewhere ahead on the screen to use it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you start a new game, press continue. New game will sent back us at the beginning of the level. To call up the menu serves the â€œtabâ€. Fortunately, you do not need him practically at all to use. Only at the beginning and at the end to quit the application.\r\n\r\nrequires Windows 64bit and a little patience \r\n\r\nArchive packed 7zip\r\n\r\nFrom this place a great favor to the players for test game. \r\nIs game has crashed, lagging or lose texture, etc. + a specification of your computer. GPU / CPU / RAM / OS\r\nAll suggestions are very welcome.\r\n\r\nI upload game onfast download with zero problems.\r\n\r\nGreeting!\r\nPatrick","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3341cefbc23bd46da174ba72c2b736d45940ae76","amp;dn":"goldenrunerver0.85+gamedev","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3341cefbc23bd46da174ba72c2b736d45940ae76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,65,206,251,194,59,212,109,161,116,186,114,194,183,54,212,89,64,174,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
