He ends with an impassioned plea for the widespread return of the fig leaf to redeem modern art from cheap sensation and innuendo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:781a8c36cf2cf1a80de85aa4f3cbd7f8bebfd5c5","amp;dn":"Fig.Leaf.The.Biggest.Cover.Up.in.History.EN.SUB.x265.WEBRIP.MPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"781a8c36cf2cf1a80de85aa4f3cbd7f8bebfd5c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,26,140,54,207,44,241,168,13,232,90,164,243,203,215,248,190,191,213,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
