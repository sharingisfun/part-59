More Better Different sees Karn utilising guitars, clarinet, samples and spoken word in nine mood pieces, which swing from the winningly funky The Jump to the cinematic noodling of The End Gag to the wah guitar and 80's sci-fi soundtrack stylings of Atyan B-Boot.\r\n\r\nIf you were into Japan, David Sylvian or Mick Karn then buy this. If you have never heard of them then buy this! This isn't a dance album or even sonic wallpaper; it demands your full attention and rewards you with a sublime yet energetic musical masterpiece. \r\n\r\nTurn it up loud and wobble you're your speakers with enormous, tightly controlled bass and let the sublime melodies soak in. Mick Karn, the Worlds most respected bass player deploys his trademark fretless whale like WAL bass accompanied by woodwind, drums and intriguing samples. \r\n\r\nIn my view this IS Mick Karn's finest album to date. If you appreciate the more creative and experimental artists such as Siouxsie Sioux, Bjork and Kate Bush then you will appreciate this. It needs time to grow on you; it captures you and then never lets you go.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - The Jump\r\n02 - Atyan B-Boot\r\n03 - It's His Birthday This Year\r\n04 - Never Thought\r\n05 - The Show\r\n06 - The End Gag\r\n07 - Wishy-Washy Wishing\r\n08 - Pulsating Puddles\r\n09 - Great Day In The Morning\r\n\r\nÂ© 2003 Invisible Hands Music / Medium Productions | IHCD 33\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel: Mick karn - bass guitar, guitar, clarinet, bass clarinet, keyboards, samples, vocals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapan (David Sylvian) - Gentlemen Take Polaroids (1980) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/12623709/_Japan_%28David_Sylvian%29_-_Gentlemen_Take_Polaroids_%281980%29_[EAC-\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Sylvian - Blemish (2003) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11666830/David_Sylvian_-_Blemish_%282003%29_[EAC-FLAC]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bde79a08741bfcdd3584b83ae6f37d27a4fb91e","amp;dn":"Mick+Karn+%28Japan%29+-+More+Better+Different+%282003%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bde79a08741bfcdd3584b83ae6f37d27a4fb91e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,222,121,160,135,65,191,205,211,88,75,131,174,111,55,210,122,79,185,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
