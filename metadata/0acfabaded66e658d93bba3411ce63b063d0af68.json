Grunge singer, plus cool r-n-b female backing vocals on some tracks. Big Chief seems to draw a wide influence from Zeppelin to Kyuss to rap to funk. Short spoken intros on some songs. Production and sound quality A-1. Released thru Caroline/Sub Pop. Disc loses a little steam after track 6, but overall way stronger than the Drive It Off release. \r\nIf you are into bands like Mudhoney, Nebula, Kyuss, early Monster Magnet, maybe even Rage Against the Machine or Soundgarden, give this a listen.
