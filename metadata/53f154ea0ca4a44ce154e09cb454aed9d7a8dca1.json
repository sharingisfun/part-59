The U.S. release has a runtime of 98m and the French one has a runtime of 105m. They also have some editorial differences, such as different camera angles... The U.S. release apparently contains a scene the other one doesn't, but I haven't seen it in a while, so I can't vouch for that. \r\nThe audio may contain some minor glitches - for some reason, the French version seems impossible to find on the Internet with the English audio track, and the only way for me to get a decent quality file of the French version was to download pieces of it from YouTube (thanks to the uploader btw), glue them together, rip the audio from the resulting file and stitch it (after very, and I stress it, very unprofessional editing) to a Russian-language DVDRip.\r\nNow, this might not be ideal. But I tried to do this before and I failed and now I've succeeded. It's important to me, especially now, and I want to share it. Because, you know, this version obviously has more footage. You see. More Bowie. And more Bowie is what we need now. I know I do. I always will","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53f154ea0ca4a44ce154e09cb454aed9d7a8dca1","amp;dn":"The+Linguini+Incident+%281991%29+French+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53f154ea0ca4a44ce154e09cb454aed9d7a8dca1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,241,84,234,12,164,164,76,225,84,224,156,180,84,174,217,215,168,220,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
