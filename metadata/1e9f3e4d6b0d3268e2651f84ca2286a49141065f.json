They are a little dated now.  The &quot;special effects&quot; are not so special now.\r\n\r\nThis is packaged on 10 DVDs.  5 for each of the two seasons the show ran.  I saw much of this series as a kid and one of them really shook me.  Was good to see it later and find out how hokey it was and get that out of my brain!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9f3e4d6b0d3268e2651f84ca2286a49141065f","amp;dn":"Science+Fiction+Theater+-+S01D01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e9f3e4d6b0d3268e2651f84ca2286a49141065f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,159,62,77,107,13,50,104,226,101,31,132,202,34,134,164,145,65,6,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
