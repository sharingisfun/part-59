In his career of nearly half a century, he was responsible for more than 40 films - features, documentaries, and educational shorts. His legacy includes South Africa's single most successful film to date The Gods must be Crazy. Daar doer in die Bosveld, Uys's first film, and South Africa's first colour film, was released in 1951. Irrespective of its many technical flaws the popularity of Daar doer in die Bosveld spread like a wildfire, especially in the rural farming areas.\r\n\r\nThe film is a comedy about a shy farmer named Hans Botha who is asked to pick up a young school teacher named Martie du Toit. When Hans arrives at the bus stop to pick up Martie he is completely dumbstruck by her beauty and only able to say the phrases, &quot;It looks like rain&quot; and &quot;It was an accident.&quot; The two experience many difficulties along the way, mostly due to Hans's ancient car. When the pair arrive at Martie's destination, Martie is soaking wet and convinced that Hans is an idiot. Hans, however, is utterly in love with her.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 626x472, 23.976 fps, 1981 kbps, 01h01m23s\r\nAudio: AAC, 44100 Hz, stereo, 160 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Afrikaans audio, English subtitles hardcoded\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/gw4xxkzmv/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/lmmwlkewr/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ll8deenp7/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/7dioprb0b/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/o008yu3y3/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:284a8484d19c75ddeefeaa7a0df53cc7f1432d98","amp;dn":"Far+Away+in+the+Bushveld+%281951+-+South+Africa%29%5BAfrikaans%5D+comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"284a8484d19c75ddeefeaa7a0df53cc7f1432d98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,74,132,132,209,156,117,221,238,254,170,122,13,245,60,199,241,67,45,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
