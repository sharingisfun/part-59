Amy's father has passed away and David intends to write his screenplay about Stalingrad in the house. David hires the contractor Charlie and his team to repair the roof of the Barn. Amy was the sweetheart of Charlie when she lived there and neither him nor his crew show respect to her. Charlie invites David to hunt deers with his group and him but they leave David alone in the woods and rape Amy. She does not tell to David what happened but when the drunken coach Tom Heddon calls Charlie and his friends to hunt down the slow Jeremy Niles that likes his daughter, David decides to protect not only Jeremy, but also Amy and his honor.                \r\n\r\nYear: 2011                \r\nDirector: Rod Lurie                \r\nWriters: Rod Lurie, David Zelag Goodman, Sam Peckinpah, Gordon Williams                \r\nStars: James Marsden, Kate Bosworth, Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd, James Woods, Dominic Purcell, Rhys Coiro, Billy Lush, Laz Alonso, Willa Holland, Walton Goggins                \r\nGenres: Horror, Thriller                \r\nLanguage: English                \r\n\r\nRELEASE.....................: Straw.Dogs.2011.1080p.BluRay.x264.VPPV\r\nVIDEO.......................: 3000 kbps  \r\nCODEC.......................: x264\r\nRESOLUTION..................: 1920x800                \r\nFRAME RATE..................: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.......................: 5.1 Channel / AC3 / 384kbps                \r\nFILE SIZE / FORMAT..........: 2.60GB / MP4\r\nSOURCE......................: BluRay                \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster:  \nhttp://snap.vppv.la/straw-dogs/2011/straw-dogs-2011-poster.jpg               \r\n\r\nWarning!!!
