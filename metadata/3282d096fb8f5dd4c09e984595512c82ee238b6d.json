Beer-bellied Dinosaur. King Rat of Madagascar @sidperkins @sciencemagazine.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦The new fossil of the presumed proto-ichthyosaur was unearthed from rocks in eastern China in 2011. Those rocks were laid down as marine sediments about 248 million years ago, Jiang says. The well-preserved fossil is quite complete, with only a portion of the tail missing, he notes. When alive, the creature was probably about 40 centimeters longâ€”about the size of a large lizardâ€”and weighed about 2 kilograms.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe fossilâ€™s vertebrae and ribs are thick-walled and well mineralized, so the creature was probably an adult when it died. But most bones in the forelimbs were small and widely separated, a sign that the forelimbs were likely cartilage-filled flippers and not legs, Jiang says. The creatureâ€™s hindlimbs were reduced in size, another adaptation for life at sea. The new speciesâ€™ name, Cartorhynchus lenticarpus, comes from the Greek words for â€œshort snoutâ€ (another feature of the fossil) and Latin words for â€œflexible wrist.â€ The creatureâ€™s heavy bones, like a scuba diverâ€™s weight belt, counteracted natural buoyancy and probably enabled it to forage in shallow coastal waters, Jiang says. Yet C. lenticarpus could probably get around well on land using its flippers, just as seals and sea lions do today. Jiang and his colleagues describe the new species online today in Natureâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2014/11/how-ichthyosaur-got-its-fins\r\n \nhttp://www.nature.com/news/fossils-reveal-beer-bellied-dinosaur-1.16203\r\n \nhttp://news.sciencemag.org/paleontology/2014/11/meet-vintana-second-largest-mammal-lived-dinosaurs\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3282d096fb8f5dd4c09e984595512c82ee238b6d","amp;dn":"Dinosaur+That+Went+Back+to+the+Sea+-Beer-bellied+Dinosaur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3282d096fb8f5dd4c09e984595512c82ee238b6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,130,208,150,251,143,93,212,192,158,152,69,149,81,44,130,238,35,139,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
