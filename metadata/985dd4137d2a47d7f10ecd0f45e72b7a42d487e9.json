Charles Pellegrino, author â€œTo Hell and Back: The Last Train from Hiroshima.&quot;\r\n\r\nJohn Batchelor May 12, 2016 Podcast\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦The world instead never should have had to confront the horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or the fire bombing of Dresden, or the D-Day invasion. If statesmen and rulers had taken seriously their responsibility to protect, the world would have been spared a slaughter that few of us today can imagine.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhen Barack Obama visits the Cenotaph in Hiroshima, he should therefore not talk about a world without nuclear weapons, for such a thing is more fanciful now than in 2009. Instead, he should stand by his Japanese counterpart, and reflect on our ability to move past the gaping wounds of war, to ally together to keep peace. He should laud the long record of partnership among democratic nations that emerged from the ashes of war.\r\n\r\nâ€œAbove all, Obama should use his visit to reaffirm the liberal worldâ€™s commitment to preserving and defending todayâ€™s precarious global order, in the face of murderous rampages by IS, of Russian aggression in Europe and the Middle East, and of increasingly threatening Chinese and North Korean actionsâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttps://www.aei.org/publication/obama-should-go-to-hiroshima-but-not-for-the-reason-he-gave/\r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\nI have travelled with Pellegrino to Japan to visit survivors of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, and to consult with officials and historians there. Among that community he is well respected and considered an important voice for the history of these events. Pellegrino combines intense forensic detailâ€”some of it new to historyâ€”with unfathomable heartbreak. The author unflinchingly chronicles these most devastating events in Japan, the only times nuclear weapons have been used against human beings, and begs us to hold hands and to pray that it never happens again. A must read for anyone with a conscience. (James Cameron, director, producer, engineer, and explorer)\r\n\r\nBy far the best book I have ever read on the subject. . . . No one I know has ever articulated more fully, more accurately, and more effectively the essential nature of the atomic bombings. A great bookâ€”a potential game-changer in the struggle to eliminate nuclear weapons. (Steven Leeper, Hiroshima Jogakuin University, former chair of the Hiroshima Peace Culture Foundation)\r\n\r\nThe book opens with imagery that leaves one speechless. Pellegrino is a poet at heart, a poet with a Japanese soul. (Francis Kakugawa, poet, Hiroshima family member)\r\n\r\nDrawing on his considerable scholarly skills as well as his poetic sensibility, Charles Pellegrino has greatly enlarged our understanding of the singular tragedy that wasâ€”and isâ€”Hiroshima. The pages themselves seem to weep, drenched as they are in poignancy, passion, and a salutary measure of unbearable truth.(James Morrow, author of Shambling Towards Hiroshima and This Is the Way the World Ends)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:985dd4137d2a47d7f10ecd0f45e72b7a42d487e9","amp;dn":"Hiroshima+Obama+Atomic+Wars+John+Batchelor.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"985dd4137d2a47d7f10ecd0f45e72b7a42d487e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,93,212,19,125,42,71,215,241,14,205,15,69,231,43,122,66,212,135,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
