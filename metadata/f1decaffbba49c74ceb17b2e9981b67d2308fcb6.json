These evil old people had long been dreaming of getting back their former vigor and youth. But to do that, they had to find people who aimlessly waste their time. And they were very lucky, four schoolchildren had proved ideal guinea pigs for the magicians. The kids and the old people changed their roles for a while. You can't even imagine what happened! The schoolchildren had to hide for some time in an abandoned house on the outskirts of the town, they just couldn't appear before their parents as bearded, bent, old persons. Meanwhile, the sorcerers had their fun at school in the guise of their victims. And only on a certain day and at a certain hour, time could be turned back again.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: DivX5, 640x480, 25.000 fps, 2136 Kbps, 01h15m40s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, 6 channel, 448 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Russian audio\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles Chinese, Deutsch, English, EspaÃ±ol, FranÃ§ais, Hebrew, Italiano\r\n                   Japanese, Nederlands, PortuguÃªs, Russian, Svenska\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/sl358vb3l/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/76ooed69d/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/yg01sv7ch/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/e7co7581d/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/kwem9f3zl/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1decaffbba49c74ceb17b2e9981b67d2308fcb6","amp;dn":"Skazka+o+poteryannom+vremeni+%5B1964+-+USSR%5D+comedy+multi+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1decaffbba49c74ceb17b2e9981b67d2308fcb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,222,202,255,187,164,156,116,206,177,123,46,153,129,182,125,35,8,252,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
