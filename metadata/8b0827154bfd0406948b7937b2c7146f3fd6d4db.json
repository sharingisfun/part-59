All making it easier to share and collaborate on your work with others.\r\n\r\nCollaboration - Real-time co-authoring is available in the Office Online apps today and we're bringing that experience to the Windows Desktop applications, starting with Word. When you and your team are working in Word 2016 and/or Office online, you'll be able to see where other editors are working and what they are writing - all in real-time.\r\n\r\nSmart Applications - Applications will learn as you work, taking advantage of subtle cues and clues to help you stay on task and get more out of Office. Tell Me, a new search tool available in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, serves up the commands you need by simply typing what you want to do. Clutter - a new Exchange feature that lights up in Outlook - uses machine learning to analyze your email patterns and de-clutter your inbox by moving lower priority messages out of your way and into a new Clutter folder. And Insights, powered by Bing, finds you contextual information from the web within the reading experience.\r\n\r\nData analysis made faster and easier - New analysis capabilities are built into Excel, so you can pull, map, analyze and visualize your data faster and easier than ever.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ One-click forecasting.
