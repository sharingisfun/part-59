It has done nothing for us but come close to ensuring the ultimate annihilation of the human species. It has not solved a single â€œproblemâ€ without creating more problems â€“the endless, exponential and unchecked growth of human population, depletion of resources, and chronic depression, stress and anxiety. Its technological and â€œmoralâ€ â€œadvancementsâ€ only give us the illusion of security and peace while threatening to wipe out or enslave not only humanity but most life on the planet. This satirical book mounts a scathing, caustic attack on all systems of belief founded on irrational assumptions and seeks to build a coherent philosophy based on logic and the comparative behavior of apex social mammals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31c963aa8f37bf20f39fd7022382f7e7d59f2b33","amp;dn":"Rise+Like+Lions%3A+Language+and+the+False+Gods+of+Civilization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31c963aa8f37bf20f39fd7022382f7e7d59f2b33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,201,99,170,143,55,191,32,243,159,215,2,35,130,247,231,213,159,43,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
