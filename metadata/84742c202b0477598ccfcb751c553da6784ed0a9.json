The point was that it would take like, 5 minutes to even just do a find+replace to get Chelsea's name in there.\r\n\r\nSo I did.\r\n\r\nI decided that it would be better to misgender a bunch a cis dudes than a trans woman, so I also did a find+replace on he, him, and his.\r\n\r\nI can't promise I got anything, and the source material is bound to be disturbing in parts. I'm also not a graphic designer, so the back cover might have some missed pronouns because I didn't care to do a cut/paste on it.\r\n\r\nOriginal file sourced on BookZZ.org\r\n\r\nrip in peace","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84742c202b0477598ccfcb751c553da6784ed0a9","amp;dn":"The+Passion+of+Chelsea+Manning+-+DeCis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84742c202b0477598ccfcb751c553da6784ed0a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,116,44,32,43,4,119,89,140,207,203,117,28,85,61,166,120,78,208,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
