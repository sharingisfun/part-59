Now in her 60s, she released her debut album in 1971 and her most recent album Slipstream in 2012. \r\n This set roams across her career and includes signature songs like Love Has No Pride, Nick of Time and the bluesy Love Me Like a Man. The slide guitar-slinging, flame-haired queen of roots and blues rock is joined by frequent collaborator and songwriter Paul Brady on Marriage Made in Hollywood and there's even a bluesy romp through the old Elvis tune, A Big Hunk o' Love\r\n\r\n\r\nSetlist:\r\n01 - Titles\r\n02 - Used To Rule The World\r\n03 - Right Down The Line\r\n04 - Thing Called Love\r\n05 - Million Miles\r\n06 - Love Has No Pride\r\n07 - Nick Of Time\r\n08 - Marriage Made In Hollywood\r\n09 - Love Me Like A Man\r\n10 - I Can't Make You Love Me\r\n11 - Hunk Of Love\r\nRun time:-  00:57:36\r\n\r\n\r\nGSpot Says:\r\nDVD VOB format\r\nMPEG-2Program Stream &lt;&lt; (1 vid, 1 aud)\r\nSys Bitrate 10080 kb/s VBR 8646 kbps I/L TFF\r\nPAL 16:9\r\n\r\nAC3 0xbd[0x80]:48000Hz 384 kb/s tot,\r\nStereo (2/0)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlay It LOUD!\r\n\r\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a76f602606711bf6848abf7f42ee6ec93a3056d","amp;dn":"Bonnie+Raitt-2013-BBCFourSessions-NorthLondon-DVD5-PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a76f602606711bf6848abf7f42ee6ec93a3056d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,118,246,2,96,103,17,191,104,72,171,247,244,46,230,236,147,163,5,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
