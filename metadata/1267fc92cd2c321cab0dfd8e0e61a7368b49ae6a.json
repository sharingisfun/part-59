Weâ€™ll just say weâ€™re just four people who decided to work together in what they love. We want to write the rest of the story with you.&quot;\r\n\r\nTelephantomâ€™s music is a blast of refreshing indie pop, cleverly packaged in a variety of delightful ways along the pop spectrum. While the layers of synthtetic and organic textures can often be heard in their music, they are not afraid of a more stripped down and minimal aproach and are able to do it effectively without losing their identity. Their sound includes elements of indie rock, dreampop, synthpop, and even EDM, but their influences are much more vast. Perhaps this is the reason for Telephantom's effective and cohesive pop sound, which they have described as &quot;technicolor dreams for your ears&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic Videos: \r\n\rPage:\r\n\r\nInstagram: \nhttp://www.instagram.com/telephantomband\r\n\r\nTwitter:\r\n\r\nSoundCloud:\r\n\r\nBandCamp:\r\n\r\nLast.FM \nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Telephantom\r\n\r\nPhotos: \nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/telephantom\r\n\r\nOfficial: \nhttp://telephantom.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1267fc92cd2c321cab0dfd8e0e61a7368b49ae6a","amp;dn":"Telephantom+-+Been+Looking+At+You+EP+-+2016+-+256K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1267fc92cd2c321cab0dfd8e0e61a7368b49ae6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,103,252,146,205,44,50,28,171,13,253,142,14,97,167,54,139,73,174,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
