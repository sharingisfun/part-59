It features a breakthrough BeatLock engine that will keep your songs in tune and let you work your mixes incredibly faster than any other DJ. VirtualDJ will let you mix and scratch music videos right from your turntables. The software is compatible with timecoded vinyls that let you scratch your MP3s directly on a real turntable, and with many other DJ equipment. Add to that the infinite number of cue points a DJ can save for each song and large collection of wonderful automatically beat-synchronized effects. You can use several interfaces to suit both beginners and professionals, record your mixes and burn them on CD, rip DVD, rip vinyl, create your own Internet radio, automatically mix playlists, use VST effects, display karaoke, and play DRMed file! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe automatic seamless loop engine and synchronized sampler lets the DJ perform astounding remixes live, with no preparation at all. The visual representation and the cues allow a DJ to clearly see the song structure, and never be surprised by a break. The vinyl controls will let you scratch like on a real turntable, except that with the beatlock engine your scratches will never end out of the beat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtualDJ Basic features:\r\n* up to 99 independent zero-latency players with:\r\no Standard controls (play, pause, stop, cue)\r\no Pitch control with Master Tempo (from -100% to +100%)\r\no 3 band equalizer High, Mid, and Low with Kill and +/-30db gain\r\no Independant key control\r\no Resonant filter\r\n* One-click beat matching and synchronization (FAME algorithm)\r\n* BeatLock engine for keeping songs in-sync and in-time\r\n* Dynamic beat-matching visualizer\r\n* Automatic beat-matched crossfading\r\n* Automatic BPM and KEY calculation\r\n* Automatic pitch matching\r\n* Automatic audio gain matching\r\n* Real scratch simulation\r\n* Automatic seamless and beat-aware LOOP functionality\r\n* Synchronized sampler with 12 instant record and playback slots\r\n* Time-Stretch and Master Tempo Pitch algorithms\r\n* Automatic first beat and last beat detection\r\n* Automatic 4/4 phase detection\r\n* Infinite number of cue points per song saved for instant recall each time the song is loaded\r\n\r\n* VST effects compatibility (PC version Only)\r\n* Video mix with windowed or FULL SCREEN TV output using 2nd video output\r\n* Karaoke CDG+MP3 and/or ZIP support\r\n* FreeFrame and custom video effects\r\n* Infinite number of video effects applied simultaneously\r\n* DJ-specific video transition plugins\r\n* Song database engine with easy-to-use search feature\r\n* CoverFlow or text-only song browsing\r\n* Compatible with iTunes playlists (iTunes DRM files not supported)\r\n* MP3 ID3 Tag compatibility\r\n* User-defined automatic filter folders\r\n* Automatic Hot-Swap of external hard drives\r\n* Ready-to-burn recording of a DJs mix to CD\r\n* Broadcast on the Internet\r\n* CD to MP3 encoder\r\n* Multi-channel sound card, dual-sound card or Y-splitter output for real-time monitoring or external mixer use\r\n* ASIO soundcard compatibility\r\n* CoreAudio soundcard compatibility\r\n* Fully customizable skin engine and shortcut macro engine\r\n* VDJScript: powerful macro language used in skins, shortcuts, or controller mapping\r\n* Compatibility and customizable mapping with most external MIDI and HID controllers (more than 80 included, many more downloadable)\r\n* Optional automatic playlist mixing: VirtualDJ recognizes the style of the music (techno, hip hop, lounge) and adapts the mix accordingly\r\n* Netsearch: search and play any song from an online database of more than 8 million tracks\r\n* MusicGroup: get live recommendations based on what you play and the feedback from millions of other DJs around the world\r\n* GenuisDJ: automatically fill your folders with the latest hits depending on what you usually play\r\n\r\nWhat's new\r\n- sampler_group_mute action added\r\n- Fix possible waveform overview crash when using line in\r\n- Fix crash on exit when notification is visible\r\n- Fix custom definitions (with force-) not being loaded (regression)\r\n- Safer switching between camera's\r\n- Fix multiple threads being started when changing camera resolution \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------+\r\n| How to use |\r\n+----------------+\r\n1) Open _ReadMe.txt and read Instructions \r\n\r\n\r\nSupport topic:  http://techtools.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=12\r\n\r\n   \r\nAny comments on quality appreciated\r\n\r\nThumperDC / TechTools\r\n\r\n\r\n====================================================================================\r\nIf you need help please post in our forum, Thanks  http://techtools.net/\r\n====================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c1bd5b9e7ed8b44054264090f905e76d9f0119f","amp;dn":"Atomix+VirtualDJ+Pro+Infinity+8+1+2832+1112+%2B+Content+%5BTechTools","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c1bd5b9e7ed8b44054264090f905e76d9f0119f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,27,213,185,231,237,139,68,5,66,100,9,15,144,94,118,217,240,17,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
