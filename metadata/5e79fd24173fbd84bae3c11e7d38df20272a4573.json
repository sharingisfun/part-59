They were later joined by Erlend Skomsvoll and Live Maria Roggen, playing their first notable concert as a group at the Nattjazz festival in Bergen, May 1998. Signed to Bugge Wesseltoft's new label Jazzland, they released their first album in 1999, produced by Wesseltoft. From 2000â€“2001, Wibutee was also joined by ex-The September When bass player Gulleiv Wee on electronics. Roggen and Skomsvoll left the band in 2000. Pioneer in Norwegian electronica, Rune Â«SternklangÂ» BrÃ¸ndbo joined the group in 2001, just before the release of their second album Eight Domestic Challenges. The pure instrumental album was produced by the band itself. The constellation continued through 2004, releasing Playmachine in June 2004. Per Zanussi left Wibutee in October 2004. The bass chair was then taken by Marius ReksjÃ¸, finally by Tor Egil Kreken. Wibutee was working towards a more melodic concept than before, but still with Kornstad's easily recognisable tenor saxophone in front. In early 2006 Wibutee launched their own label Sonne Disk with their following album Sweet Mental.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCover and Arworks included (jpg low)\r\nMore info on original release (italian language):  \nhttp://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/index.php?showtopic=484809","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e79fd24173fbd84bae3c11e7d38df20272a4573","amp;dn":"Wibutee+-+Newborn+Thing+%281999%29%5BMp3+192%5D%5BTNT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e79fd24173fbd84bae3c11e7d38df20272a4573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,121,253,36,23,63,189,132,186,227,193,30,125,56,223,32,39,42,69,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
