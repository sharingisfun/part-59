Treason, lies, and backstabbing. A make-believe affair that turns into a real mating.\r\n\r\nTimothy Sands is a PBI counselor, half-fey, half-elf, with a secret crush on Herman Weiss, PBI director. As a new chapter is added to the Leader Murders, it is Weissâ€™s responsibility to investigate what seems an impossible-to-solve case. The other problem? Weiss is suffering from rages, and his only salvation lies in Timâ€™s emotional-grid-balancing skills.

The stakes are upped when Timothyâ€™s father, the Fey King, threatens to leave the Council destitute if they donâ€™t hand Timothy over to him. Weissâ€™s brilliant solution? Mating Timothy and forcing the Council into protecting him.\r\n\r\nThereâ€™s only one small hitch in that plan: instead of protecting one, the Council might decide to get rid of two","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffabb586b77d992246a8204e061f9e6e2a1918cd","amp;dn":"Counselor+among+Wolves+Liv+Olteano","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffabb586b77d992246a8204e061f9e6e2a1918cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,171,181,134,183,125,153,34,70,168,32,78,6,31,158,110,42,25,24,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
