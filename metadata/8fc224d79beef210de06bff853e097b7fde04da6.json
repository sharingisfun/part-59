Cybersecurity Obama. @danhenninger, WSJ Editorial. David Shedd, Boston Herald\r\n\r\nMay 12, 2016 John Batchelor mp3\r\nThe rapprochement between the GOP's presumed standard-bearer and its top elected official â€” assuming that's what this is â€” is clearly a work in progress. The two are on separate planets, ideologically and temperamentally, and one much-hyped morning summit was never going to produce some magical mind-meld.\r\n\r\nBut now â€” after a get-together that was described by sources as pleasant, productive, even interesting â€” Trump and Ryan are waltzing toward &quot;unity,&quot; or something approaching it.\r\n\r\nThe two teams are beginning a slate of policy discussions to explore their positions on key issues. They might not find agreement on some issues, but they hope they can lock arms on broad principles that will drive the election.\r\n\r\nRyan and Trump will meet again. And House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers extended an invitation to Trump to speak to the entire House GOP.\r\n \nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/paul-ryan-donald-trump-meeting-223125#ixzz48USZlgIu\r\n \nhttp://www.bostonherald.com/opinion/op_ed/2016/05/shedd_obama_s_cybersecurity_plan_far_too_little_way_too_late\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc224d79beef210de06bff853e097b7fde04da6","amp;dn":"Ryan+Trump+Cybersecurity+Obama+John+Batchelor.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fc224d79beef210de06bff853e097b7fde04da6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,194,36,215,155,238,242,16,222,6,191,248,83,224,151,183,253,224,77,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
