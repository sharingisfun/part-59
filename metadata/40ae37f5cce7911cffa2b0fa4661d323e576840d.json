Eun-ho is tense, irritable and difficult to work with, but Jung-eun finds her assignment fascinating because Eun-ho claims he began acting not because he wanted to become a star but because he thought being in the limelight would help him find his first love, Ji Eun-dong. Eun-ho and Eun-dong's complicated romantic history has spanned two decades, and he's convinced that he can never love anyone else. As Jung-eun helps him remember Eun-dong and why he lost her, Eun-ho (whose birth name is Park Hyun-soo) looks back on his memories of her, from when they met in 1995 when he was seventeen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40ae37f5cce7911cffa2b0fa4661d323e576840d","amp;dn":"My+Love+Eun+Dong+-+COMPLETE+EPISODES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40ae37f5cce7911cffa2b0fa4661d323e576840d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,174,55,245,204,231,145,28,255,162,176,250,70,97,211,35,229,118,132,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
