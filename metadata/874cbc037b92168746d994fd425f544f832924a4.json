With a can-do attitude, plenty of grit, and her trusty vacpack, Beatrix attempts to stake a claim, amass a fortune, and avoid the continual peril that looms from the rolling, jiggling avalanche of slimes around every corner.\r\n\r\nSounds great! Give me more details!\r\nSlime Rancher is a first-person, sandbox experience where players will solve problems and survive through mastery of their vacpack: a vacuum/cannon/backpack that can vacuum up and blast out anything that isnâ€™t nailed to the ground.\r\n\r\nEach day will present new challenges to players as they attempt to amass a great fortune in the business of slime ranching. While players are free to approach these challenges however they wish, a typical day might look like this:\r\n\r\n    You wake at the crack of dawn and get to watering the crops at the ranch. Some slimes are vegetarian, after all. Then itâ€™s time to gather up the plumpest hens from the chicken coop. Some slimes are totally not vegetarian, after all.\r\n\r\n    Next, youâ€™re off to feed slimes their breakfast over at the slime corrals so they donâ€™t get too out of hand during the day. Hungry slimes get jumpy. Jumpy slimes canâ€™t be contained.\r\n\r\n    With your ranch set for the day, itâ€™s time to begin exploring the untamed wilds of the Far, Far Range. Along the way, youâ€™ll encounter slimes youâ€™ve never seen before, discover a new type of veggie to cultivate back at the ranch, and narrowly avoid certain doom in a valley of burly, feral slimes.\r\n\r\n    With the sun setting, itâ€™s time to head back to the ranch, rustle up some dinner for your slimes, and try and figure out just how the heck youâ€™ll keep these new slimes that seem to, well, explode all the time.\r\n\r\n    But you can do this. You had the courage to travel a thousand light years away from home to make a living as a slime rancher. Slimes that go boom? No problem. Slimes that burn with a radioactive aura? Bring it on. Slimes that wiggle their butts? Wait, do slimes even have butts?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:874cbc037b92168746d994fd425f544f832924a4","amp;dn":"victim+of+its+own+success+v0.2.4b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"874cbc037b92168746d994fd425f544f832924a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,76,188,3,123,146,22,135,70,217,148,253,66,95,84,79,131,41,36,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
