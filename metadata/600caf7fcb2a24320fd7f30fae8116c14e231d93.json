They are a little dated now.  The &quot;special effects&quot; are not so special now.\r\n\r\nThis is packaged on 10 DVDs.  5 for each of the two seasons the show ran.  I saw much of this series as a kid and one of them really shook me.  Was good to see it later and find out how hokey it was and get that out of my brain!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:600caf7fcb2a24320fd7f30fae8116c14e231d93","amp;dn":"Science+Fiction+Theater+-+S01D02+Ep.09-16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"600caf7fcb2a24320fd7f30fae8116c14e231d93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,12,175,127,203,42,36,50,15,215,243,15,174,129,22,193,78,35,29,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
