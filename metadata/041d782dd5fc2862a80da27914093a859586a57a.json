Approach this album with an open mind, though, and you'll find it to be one of their strongest, most eclectic LPs, with many fine songs that remain unknown to all but Stones devotees. The lyrics are getting better (if more savage), and the arrangements more creative, on brooding near-classics like &quot;All Sold Out,&quot; &quot;My Obsession,&quot; and &quot;Yesterday's Papers.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;She Smiled Sweetly&quot; shows their hidden romantic side at its best, while &quot;Connection&quot; is one of the record's few slabs of conventionally driving rock. The best tracks on the American edition were the two songs that gave the group a double-sided number one in early 1967: the lustful &quot;Let's Spend the Night Together&quot; and the beautiful, melancholy &quot;Ruby Tuesday,&quot; which is as melodic as anything Mick Jagger and Keith Richards would ever write.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Let's Spend The Night Together\r\n02 - Yesterday's Papers\r\n03 - Ruby Tuesday\r\n04 - Connection\r\n05 - She Smiled Sweetly\r\n06 - Cool, Calm &amp; Collected\r\n07 - All Sold Out\r\n08 - My Obsession\r\n09 - Who's Been Sleeping Here\r\n10 - Complicated\r\n11 - Miss Amanda Jones\r\n12 - Something Happened To Me Yesterday\r\n\r\n*2006 ABKCO Records / Universal Music Japan | UICY-93023\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Rolling Stones Japan Mini LP DSD Remaster 2006:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones - 12x5 (1964) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n       \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10760623/The_Rolling_Stones_-_12x5_%281964%29__%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones - England's Newest Hit Makers (1964) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n        \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10751837/The_Rolling_Stones_-_England_s_Newest_Hit_Makers_%281964%29_%5BEAC-FLA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones - The Rolling Stones, Now!
