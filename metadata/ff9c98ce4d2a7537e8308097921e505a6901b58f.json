It has 6 songs, which are in a slightly different mix than what appears on Slow, Deep and Hard, though they are vary similar.\r\n\r\nTrack list:\r\n\r\n1. Unsuccessfully Coping with the Natural Beauty of Infidelity\r\n2. Gravitational Constant: G = 6.67 Ã— 10âˆ’8 cmâˆ’3 gmâˆ’1 secâˆ’2\r\n3. The Misinterpretation of Silence and its Disastrous Consequences\r\n4. Prelude To Agony\r\n5. Der Untermensch\r\n6. Xero Tolerance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI could never find a good quality download anywhere, and the only source I could actually find of this actual demo was on YouTube. I downloaded it in PCM WAV, ran it through Cool Edit Pro and applied &quot;Hard Limiter&quot; and &quot;Panning/Expanding&quot; to jazz it up. I then broke it down into separate tracks and then encoded it into FLAC from the original WAV file.\r\n\r\nI'd be more than happy to get a good first generation rip of this album, if one would be inclined. But, this sounds good on a radio, home or car. \r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff9c98ce4d2a7537e8308097921e505a6901b58f","amp;dn":"Repulsion+-+None+More+Negative+%28Type+O+Negative+DEMO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff9c98ce4d2a7537e8308097921e505a6901b58f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,156,152,206,77,42,117,55,232,48,128,151,146,30,80,90,105,1,181,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
