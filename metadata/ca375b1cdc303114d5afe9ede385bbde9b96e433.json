Malcolm Hoenlein @conf_of_pres. @thadmccotter.\r\n\r\nThe semiofficial Tasnim News Agency reported earlier Monday that the country fired a missile with a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) two weeks ago, citing Brig. Gen. Ali Abdollahi. The missile was precision-guided and could accurately strike a target with a 26-foot margin of error, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œBut Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan said Iran hadnâ€™t test-fired a missile of the range cited by the media, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, an apparent reference to the Tasnim report. He nevertheless said Iran was moving forward in building up its defensive capabilities, including through its ballistic missile program.\r\n\r\nBrig. Gen. Dehghan didnâ€™t explain how the conflicting reports arose, and it wasnâ€™t clear whether the earlier statement from Brig. Gen. Abdollahi was in error. Iranian officials didnâ€™t immediately respond to requests for clarification.\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-test-fires-another-ballistic-missile-1462785195\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca375b1cdc303114d5afe9ede385bbde9b96e433","amp;dn":"Iran+Fires+Missiles+Lies+-+John+Batchelor+Podcast+05102016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca375b1cdc303114d5afe9ede385bbde9b96e433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,55,91,28,220,48,49,20,213,175,233,237,227,133,187,222,155,150,228,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
