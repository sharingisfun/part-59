Host Pat Dixon - along with a revolving guest list of NYC-based attorneys, reporters, cops and comedians - provides a decidedly irreverent, dark and unflinching tour of true crime in the city. Ripped from the blood-splattered headlines of NYC's tabloid press and broadcast from the ACN Studio in New York City; this is a one of a kind show that documents the farcical evolving chaos of the new Rome.\r\n\r\nGuests: Gavin McInnes, Jimmy Failla and others\r\n\r\nEpisode 13\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98862efce1df369551edf6191e0d3e6b8a0cd988","amp;dn":"NYC+Crime+Report+13+2016-01-18+Gavin+McInnes+Jimmy+Failla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98862efce1df369551edf6191e0d3e6b8a0cd988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,134,46,252,225,223,54,149,81,237,246,25,30,13,62,107,138,12,217,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
