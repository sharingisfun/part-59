Pinto has completed work on the new film, Eye of the Phoenix: Secrets of the Dollar Bill, which is the third volume in the Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings series. With our crashing economy, the big question is: what is the future of American currency? As with the rest of our series, we believe the past will help us to understand the future.\r\n\r\nEye of the Phoenix documents the bizarre history of the design of the dollar bill, exposing the occult activity surrounding the FDR administration. There is perhaps no other period in U.S. history when so many people were so deeply involved in the occult, and held positions of power that reached all the way to the White House. Phoenix focuses specifically on the years prior to World War II leading up to 1935, when the Great Seal was taken out of obscurity and placed on the foundation of America's currency.\r\n\r\nAccording to official records from the State Department, FDR and his Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace, specifically chose to use the Great Seal because, as Freemasons, they believed the â€œNovus Ordo Seclorumâ€ (which they equated with the New Deal) could only be fulfilled under â€œthe eyeâ€ of the Great Architect of the Universe (the god of Masonry).\r\n\r\nTwo heavily influential occultists during the FDR era were Manly P. Hall and a Russian mystic named Nicholas Roerich. Manly Hall's writings influenced Freemasonic presidents FDR and Harry S. Truman. It is even said that Hall was responsible for the number of stones on the pyramid of the Great Seal, and for the identification of the eagle as a phoenix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hidden Faith of the Founding Fathers\r\n\r\nOne of America's most important founders was a man named Charles Thomson, who was said to have been closer to the events and people of the American Revolution than any other man of that era. Thomson was the Congressional secretary from 1774 to 1789, all the way through the Revolution and the establishment of the federal government. He was also the man who made the final decisions for the design of the Great Seal of the United States, which can now be found on the back of America's dollar bill.\r\n\r\nAs the new American Republic was being founded, Thomson made a detailed history of the events that took place during the Revolution and of the men who are being celebrated as heroes across the country. Though he was compelled for repeatedly to publish this history, Thomson declined, &quot;No&quot; he said, &quot;I ought not, for I should contradict all the histories of the great events of the Revolution. Let the world admire the supposed wisdom and valor of our great men.&quot; He said, &quot;I shall not undeceive future generations.&quot;\r\n\r\nAs a result, Thomson eventually destroyed his manuscript and what may have been the truest account of the American Revolution was lost for all time. It might be said that any serious investigation into America's history should begin with Thomson's story and his decision not to undeceive future generations. What did Thomson mean? What was he hiding? Since we are the future generations, what have we been deceived about?\r\n\r\nToday, the founding fathers of America are perhaps the most famous men in the world, for setting forth a new form of government that has been the marvel of the modern age. In the discussion over whether America was founded as a Christian nation, it is important to divide her history. Most agree that the Pilgrims who landed at Plymouth in 1620 were undoubtedly Christians who built their cities and schools based on the teachings of the Bible. Yet 150 years would pass before the United States was founded, as a result of the American Revolution. Because of the Christian influence early on, the Revolutionary philosophies have been embraced in what might be called &quot;Patriotic Christianity.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aad72f797f1c4c63cb7fd9a44dceb7fd07d8e8ee","amp;dn":"Secret+Societies+-+09+-+Eye+of+The+Phoenix+-+Hidden+Faith+of+Our","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aad72f797f1c4c63cb7fd9a44dceb7fd07d8e8ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,215,47,121,127,28,76,99,203,127,217,164,77,206,183,253,7,216,232,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
