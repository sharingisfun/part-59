Rich, elderly Don Alejo is poised to sell the town for a profit, needing only to buy a whorehouse to own all the buildings and close the deal. It's owned by a man and his daughter: Manuelita is gay, aging, afraid; he cross-dresses and entertains as a flamenco dancer; he wants to sell and leave. His daughter wants to stay. The return of Pancho complicates things: he's a hothead Alejo tries to control and he scared Manuelita the year before. Things come to a head as Pancho breaks Alejo's hold on him, then flirts and dances with Manuelita and finds himself at risk of being called a &quot;maricÃ³n.&quot;\r\n\r\nDirection: Arturo Ripstein\r\nAudio: Spanish\r\nSutitles: English and Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddb8e9f5265d9c73c57117825c04815256fa697e","amp;dn":"El+Lugar+Sin+Limites+%28Arturo+Ripstein%29+1978.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddb8e9f5265d9c73c57117825c04815256fa697e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,184,233,245,38,93,156,115,197,113,23,130,92,4,129,82,86,250,105,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
