Hartman was in prime form on the six ballads, and his versions of &quot;Lush Life&quot; and &quot;My One and Only Love&quot; have never been topped. Coltrane's playing throughout the session is beautiful, sympathetic, and still exploratory; he sticks exclusively to tenor on the date. At only half an hour, one wishes there were twice as much music, but what is here is classic, essential for all jazz collections.\r\n\r\nA landmark album of vocal jazz â€“ and one of the few sessions that John Coltrane ever cut with a singer! In a way, the album's more Hartman's than it is Coltrane's â€“ given that Johnny's warm, mellow style of singing isn't as free and open as Trane at his most adventurous â€“ but at another level, the album's got a great approach to Coltrane's gentler side, one that wasn't showing up on a lot of his Impulse albums of the time. Overall, the album's got an extremely haunting quality, and McCoy Tyner's piano adds as much to Hartman's hip voice as Coltrane's mellow tenor. Titles include some well-chosen moody standards â€“ including &quot;Lush Life&quot;, &quot;Dedicated To You&quot;, and &quot;Autumn Serenade&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - They Say It's Wonderful\r\n02 - Dedicated To You\r\n03 - My One And Only Love\r\n04 - Lush Life\r\n05 - You Are Too Beautiful\r\n06 - Autumn Serenade\r\n\r\n*2008 Impulse! / Verve / UMG | Verve Originals Series | 0602517648975 | LP AS-40\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nJohn Coltrane - tenor saxophone\r\nJohnny Hartman - vocals\r\nMcCoy Tuner - piano\r\nJimmy Garrison - bass\r\nElvin Jones - drums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c38700a5c2f870ad7b8ea4f8c368c7fcdac865f","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+and+Johnny+Hartman+%281963%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c38700a5c2f870ad7b8ea4f8c368c7fcdac865f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,56,112,10,92,47,135,10,215,184,234,79,140,54,140,127,205,172,134,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
