Paired against Trump alone, Sanders's lead expands to 50 percent to 39 percent.\r\n\r\nâ€œPollsters additionally found that Trump remains unpopular nationwide, with 61 percent viewing him unfavorably and 34 percent seeing him favorably.\r\n\r\nClinton fares little better, with 55 percent viewing her unfavorably and 36 percent seeing her favorably.\r\n\r\nâ€œPPP conducted its latest sampling of 1,222 registered voters via landline telephone interviews and online surveys May 6â€“9. It has a 3.2-point margin of error.\r\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:142c5fb785f43f4af508e2be9f988fb4f7d480fe","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+05102016+Watching+Ag+Az+CHINA.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"142c5fb785f43f4af508e2be9f988fb4f7d480fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,44,95,183,133,244,63,74,245,8,226,190,159,152,143,180,247,212,128,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
