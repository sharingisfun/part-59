Poor and dilapidated is the stronghold of the knight VÃ¡clav Rynda of Loucka (Rudolf HrusÃ­nskÃ½) and so is his clothing. The family property was spent by his father who, after the loss at the battle at the White Mountain, was forced to give up his faith and had to swear submission to the Catholic Church to save his skin. VÃ¡clav resembles a peasant rather than a nobleman, as he tries to find something to eat for himself and his domestics. One day, a visit comes to the stronghold. The emperor's commissioner Srandorf (Karel HÃ¶ger) and his wife ask for a night's lodging. The guest then reveals to Rynda in private that Srandorf is not their real name and that in fact they are not even married - Jindrich DonovalskÃ½ and his companion Katerina (Blanka BohdanovÃ¡) have come in the French king's employ and want to incite a revolt against the Hapsburgs in Bohemia. \r\n\r\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : Cest a slÃ¡va.1968.DVDRip.x264-mafalda.mkv\r\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 450 Kbps\r\nLength            : 1.44 GiB for 1h 24mn 21s 566ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 215 Kbps\r\nAspect            : 708 x 562 (1.343) at 25.000 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 224 Kbps\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage          : cs\r\n\r\nText #0           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n\r\nText #1           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : cs\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062786/\r\n\r\nAudio Language: Czech\r\nSubtitles: English Czech","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cd7997d911f5d4c8a9aec27e122493c202fad55","amp;dn":"Cest+a+sl%26aacute%3Bva.1968.DVDRip.x264-mafalda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cd7997d911f5d4c8a9aec27e122493c202fad55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,215,153,125,145,31,93,76,138,154,236,39,225,34,73,60,32,47,173,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
