Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Colin Flaherty\r\n\r\nEpisode 298: Itâ€™s MLK day on TACS and Anthony discusses the lack of traffic and sales, baby dolls gone wrong, a Judge Judy idiot, an (old) Mike Greenberg whoopsie, Tinder fails, and we inspect new and old ways to freshen up a vag. After we look at a few more old timey ads, Colin Flaherty joins the show to talk about racial pushback, ignoring racial violence, lack of self-responsibility, discipline in schools, â€œtabooâ€ topics, and shifts in ideology. The guys then talk about double standards, â€œOscarâ€™s so white,â€ Obamaâ€™s blatant love of race, race by area, Jada Pinkett Smith playing victim, the Image Awards, Chelsea Handler doing â€œrace,â€ inner-city school teachers, white racism, fighting victimization with the truth, and a heil Hitler granny. Ant and Colin also chat about drunken partygoers, family structures, an anti-pedophilia bill, reporting racial violence, the presidential candidates, an Uber lawsuit, TJ Sotomayor, gassing up planes, Scholastic pulling a George Washington book, a jack-off booth in NY, lowering the drinking limit, stolen weapons, and we wrap up MLK day hearing about the inspiration behind Colinâ€™s book titles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c19ab4914d559c639dc103a8457716018599cfdc","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-01-18+Colin+Flaherty+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c19ab4914d559c639dc103a8457716018599cfdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,154,180,145,77,85,156,99,157,193,3,168,69,119,22,1,133,153,207,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
