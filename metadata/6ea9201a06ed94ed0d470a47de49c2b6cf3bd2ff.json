Once designed for high-pressure environments and exploring gas giants and deep space, these mechs have been adapted for war.\r\n\r\nSecond, Templars descend from a Zendu bloodline -- a unique heritage that, with proper training and ritual, gives each Templar the ability to pass all of their memories, and those of their ancestors, to a newly born child. This memory gift is known as a Templarâ€™s Lineage â€“ and it is what gives Templars their immense advantage in combat, tactics, engineering, and the ability to drive the hulking Leviathan Battle Suits. The player takes on the role of a Templar Captain who hails from a storied Lineage reaching back over 87 generations of Templars -- enabling you to page back through the memories to help in coping with the dire situation at hand.\r\n\r\nWith the Great Exodus coming to an end, the Star Traders founded new colonies on the few remaining habitable worlds. The Templar Knights are called upon once again to defend the Star Traders and their new colonies from an ancient threat.\r\n\r\nTrese Brothers Games is one of the premier indie game development studios for desktop and mobile RPG and strategy games.
