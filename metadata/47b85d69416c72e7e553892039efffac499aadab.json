Watching Messi or Lampard (or any of the players included in â€œSoccer Menâ€) after reading Kuper is a bit like going back to Shakespeareâ€™s sonnets after reading Helen Vendlerâ€™s book on them. He turns us into more alert, more intelligent, more grateful spectators of the beautiful game.â€\r\n\r\nMother Jones\r\n\r\nâ€œKuperâ€™s effortless wit and keen sense of irony make Soccer Men well worth the read.â€\r\n\r\nAlan Black, San Francisco Chronicle\r\n\r\nâ€œSimon Kuperâ€™s new book, Soccer Men, gains insight into the personalities of some of soccerâ€™s most important players and coaches with a few extras from outside the sport thrown inâ€¦.Kuper is a rare breed of writer. His international upbringing conditioned his understanding of variety in the worldâ€™s most popular sport. His soccer networks across national boundaries and his access inside the game are impressive. There is no better anthropologistâ€™s eye analyzing the game today.â€\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47b85d69416c72e7e553892039efffac499aadab","amp;dn":"Soccer-Men-Profiles-Rogues-Geniuses-Neurotics.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47b85d69416c72e7e553892039efffac499aadab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,184,93,105,65,108,114,231,229,83,137,32,57,239,255,172,73,154,173,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
