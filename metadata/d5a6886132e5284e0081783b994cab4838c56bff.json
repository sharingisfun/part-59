That's because in Wobbly Jungle the wolf's in sheep's clothing â€“ erm, sorry... in Sina's enemies!\r\n \r\nYou have to survive 60 challenging levels that will demand everything from you. The sweet look is actually crystal clear camouflage, as a variety of enemies and obstacles lie in wait. Are you ready to face this challenge? Only those who demonstrate perfect timing and fast fingers stand any chance at all â€“ true to the motto &quot;SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST!&quot;\r\n \r\nIn addition to the 60 increasingly difficult and varied levels, lots of challenging enemy types await you, as well as a rewarding &quot;surprise&quot; at the end. Some enemies can be defeated; others you're probably better off avoiding â€“ preferably without stumbling right into the next trap. \r\n\r\n-Varied and exciting: 60 challenging levels await you \r\n-Gleeful: See where other players died and leave them behind you \r\n-Challenging: Whether or not you finish the level is entirely in your hands \r\n-Smart and forward-looking: Many enemies lie in wait â€“ it's probably best to avoid them. \r\n-Confrontational: Compare your skills with those of your friends with the level summary\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/WO89TEN.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/lQ6vJmH.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/OXA95Le.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/S4FRTho.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/nM0O5K0.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/5mXcu5E.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/p4ovmJN.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/UixgosG.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/RV5pMeh.jpg\r\n\r\nAuthors Note:\r\n\r\nPlease dont hit and run show some appreciation and say thanks/seed so you motivate me to keep sharing things that no one else has.
