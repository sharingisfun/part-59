It also include the 1987 Amplified Bible (Classic) AMPC and the AMPC+ with footnotes (previously known as AMP).\r\n\r\nThe appeal and readability of the 2015 edition of the Amplified Bible has been broadened by refreshing the English and refining the amplifications for relevance and clarity. The Amplified Bible is now easier to read and better than ever to study and understand. The Amplified Bible now includes more amplification in the Old Testament and refined amplification in the New Testament. Additionally, the Bible text has been improved to read smoothly with or without amplifications, so the text may be read clearly either way. The same feel and style of amplification has been carefully maintained, so those who read the classic Amplified Bible will easily transition to the new text and appreciate its improvements.
