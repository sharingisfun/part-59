Especially when the threat of tornadoes, and giant bears, is constant.\r\n\r\nBut in Barrow, safety is taken to extremes. Children have to wear bright yellow at all times and are never allowed outside except to go to school. How can Owen face an entire summer of that?\r\n\r\nIn secret, Owen and his friends form the Tornado Chasers. Their mission: to get as close to a Grade 5 tornado as possible. It's time for them to face their fears!\r\n\r\nAnd then... And then...\r\n\r\nThe second hilarious, thought-provoking, highly original book from an extraordinary young talent - you've never read a novel like it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb9244b5c9c04a40fa3598df2731cec9b78dea4","amp;dn":"The+Tornado+Chasers+-+Ross+Montgomery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb9244b5c9c04a40fa3598df2731cec9b78dea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,185,36,75,92,156,4,164,15,163,89,141,242,115,28,236,155,120,222,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
