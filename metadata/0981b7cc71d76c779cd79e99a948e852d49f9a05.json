There was no protesting going on whatsoever. It was bought and paid for, and it was all a scam... How many people at a rally supporting Trump would have to be injured for this president, or say Hillary Clinton, to condemn it?\r\n\r\nWhy They All Hate Ted Cruz So Much\r\n\r\nRUSH: If you know one thing, know this:  The Republican Party in Washington, establishment, whatever you want to call them, they fear government shutdowns.  They fear that more than they fear anything, because of the 1995 budget deal and repeated attempts to shut down the government.  They are scared of the media. They're scared of the Democrats. They think that's why they're losing is because they've talked about shutting down the government.  Cruz did it.  \r\n\r\nCarol Costello Calls Bill Clinton's Adultery &quot;Naughtiness&quot; -- Then Apologizes\r\n\r\nRUSH: Carol Costello is married. If her husband were a serial philanderer, if her husband routinely had trysts with 19-year-old interns in his office and if semen could be found on one of the intern's dresses, could Carol Costello refer to her husband's behavior as &quot;naughtiness&quot;?\r\n \nhttp://www.rushlimbaugh.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0981b7cc71d76c779cd79e99a948e852d49f9a05","amp;dn":"Rush+Limbaugh+-+April+29%2C+2016+Full+Podcast.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0981b7cc71d76c779cd79e99a948e852d49f9a05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,129,183,204,113,215,108,119,156,215,158,153,169,72,232,82,212,159,154,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
