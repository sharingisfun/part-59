Since the very beginning he has developed a highly individual\r\naesthetic that balances the expansive sonorities of the various instruments he\r\nwrites for with silence, texture, and space. Improvisation has a primary role\r\nin his work, but it is carefully articulated within a scored framework. Nowhere\r\nis this more evident than on Salvation Modes issued by Clean Feed. Its three\r\nlong pieces contain just one new work; the others are earlier unrecorded\r\npieces. The 27-minute opener, &quot;PrelÃºdio E Cruz de Sala&quot; is played by a quartet\r\nincluding Fala Mariam on trombone, Pedro Gomes on guitar, and CÃ©sar Burago on\r\npercussion. It's a long, developmental musical conversation. Instruments assert\r\ntheir individual tonalities in a host of combinations until the 20-minute mark,\r\nwhere they begin to dialogue as a group. As the discussion evolves, the\r\nevocation of emotion -- never overstated -- comes forth with tenderness and\r\ncontemplative awareness. &quot;Fermata,&quot; the shortest work here, is nearly ten\r\nminutes. Miguel plays finger cymbals in addition to trumpet, accompanied by\r\nAndrÃ© GonÃ§alves on a manipulated Hammond organ, Margarida Garcia on &quot;twin&quot; (an\r\nelectrified double bass), and Burago's percussion and radio. The horn is\r\nslightly more forceful and lyrical, hovering atop radio static and the skeletal\r\nbassline as the percussion finds cracks between various textures and\r\nilluminates them. In the last third, an actual blues feel comes through the\r\nwash with ghostly organ chords and Miguel's sinewy solo. The final work here,\r\n&quot;Cantata Mussurana,&quot; is based on a Creole purification ritual. The original\r\nFrench recitative was adapted for Portuguese by vocalist Kimi DjabatÃ©, and\r\nfeatures an 11-piece ensemble that includes trumpet, two bandoneons, claves,\r\nalto saxophone, trombone, trap kit, electric bass, modulated feedback, viola,\r\nand guitar. Miguel conducts as well as plays. The anchor is bassist Pedro\r\nLourenÃ§o, hovering around the notion of fragmental jazz-funk without ever\r\nactually delving into it. The interplay between whammy bar guitar, sax, claves,\r\nbrushed snare, and vocals is darkly spiritual; the spaces between instruments\r\nexpand, contract, and blur. As the work becomes denser, more animated, and\r\n(slightly) cacophonous around the 12-minute mark, each instrumental voice is\r\nheard not only in dialogue with others, but as a separate entity articulated\r\nwith equanimity, distinct for its own &quot;melodic&quot; purpose in the sheer musicality\r\nof this intoxicating whole. Though it would be difficult to choose only one of\r\nMiguel's works as a place to begin, Salvation Modes is the one that reveals him\r\nat his most imaginative, playful, and artful.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Chris Haines \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/06/sei-miguel-salvation-modes-clean-feed.html\r\n\r\nBy John Ephland \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/salvation-modes-sei-miguel-clean-feed-records-review-by-john-ephland.php\r\n\r\nBy Glenn Astarita \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/salvation-modes-sei-miguel-clean-feed-records-review-by-glenn-astarita.php\r\n\r\nBy Guy Peters (nl) \nhttp://www.enola.be/muziek/albums/24466:sei-miguel-salvation-modes\r\n\r\nDa Ettore Garzia (it)\r\n\r\nPor Bernardo Ãlvares (pt) \nhttp://www.jazz.pt/ponto-escuta/2014/10/11/sei-miguel-salvation-modes-clean-feed/\r\n\r\nPor Sara Quaresma CapitÃ£o (pt) \nhttp://mutante.pt/2014/05/5-novos-albuns-clean-feed/\r\n\r\nPar Luc Bouquet (fr)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ea27cb047cdfcee3b67248bb21bb50466553b1a","amp;dn":"Sei+Miguel+-+Salvation+Modes+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ea27cb047cdfcee3b67248bb21bb50466553b1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,162,124,176,71,205,252,238,59,103,36,139,178,27,181,4,102,85,59,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
