His product, the Wave Glider SV3, is â€œthe worldâ€™s first hybrid wave and solar propelled unmanned ocean robot,â€ the company website says. You can outfit it with sensor packs to do advanced sub-hunting, a major concern for the Pentagon, especially given Russiaâ€™s efforts to bolster its submarine fleet.\r\n\r\nâ€œLiquid Robotics does do business with the U.S. military, through prime contractors.
