It is the story of a war bride, played most sweetly by June Allyson, who scrapes a cello in a symphony band while her husband is away in the Pacific. She suffers torments because she is going to have a baby and doesn't hear from him. And it is the story of her little sister, played by tiny Margaret O'Brien, who tries to comfort her in her anxiety, and of several girl musicians who likewise try to provide cheer. Much of the action happens while the orchestra is on tour, playing at military bases throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x480, 23.976 fps, 1569 Kbps, 01h57m37s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, optional German subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/x4fdudsz5/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/p5ivs7qb5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/qw1wtp7u9/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/e3dstrw8h/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5r04sxm9d/\r\n\r\ncredit ripper b-------c and source R-, December 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3a2f564f40bbf9fe945e0622f393ab133428a1c","amp;dn":"Music+for+Millions+%5B1944+-+USA%5D+war+time+comedy+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3a2f564f40bbf9fe945e0622f393ab133428a1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,162,245,100,244,11,191,159,233,69,224,98,47,57,58,177,51,66,138,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
