Check my account for more classic bootlegs.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy, share with friends and please seed :)\r\n\r\nRoger Waters\r\nBerlin Wall Rehearsals (HRV DVD 013A)\r\n&quot;Building the Wall&quot;\r\nJuly 18-20, 1990\r\nPotsdammer Platz, Berlin\r\n\r\nLineage: Master VHS camcorder tapes &gt; Vegas 6 (AVI) &gt; MPEG-2/AC3 stereo\r\n\r\nBack in 1990, I hooked up with a journalist who was covering Roger's Berlin Wall concert for a major US publication. When he returned to the US he lent me all of his master tapes which I made dubs of. These 2nd gen copies were sent off to many of my friends encouraging them to circulate them throughout the trading communities. The linegae of all copies out there can be traced back to my 2nd gen dubs... at best.\r\n\r\nThis summer, while I was out in LA, I hooked up with the filmmaker and I persuaded him to once again lend me his masters. This time I wanted to create a series of DVDs that originated directly from the master source, but instead of simply capturing and burning these to disc, I wanted to present them in a more unique and creative manner.\r\n\r\nThis project now spans 3 DVDs. The 1st DVD features a 50-minute segment called &quot;Building the Wall&quot; and contains all the non-musical rehearsal footage. There are some nice bonus features on this disc as well. DVD 2 contains all of the\r\nmusical rehearsal footage and DVD 3 features the entire dress rehearsal. There are also 2 CDs which cover Roger and the Bleeding Heart Band's May 2nd London rehearsal (released by our friends at FRP in conjunction with HRV).\r\n\r\nDVD 1\r\n&quot;Building the Wall&quot; (approx 50 mins)\r\nAnother Brick in the Wall - Part 2 (Berlin Promo) sourced from master VHS promo tape\r\nEPK 1 \r\nEPK 2 \r\nAnimation Gallery\r\nConcert Program\r\nPower Loss\r\nExclusive Phone Interview\r\nFilmmaker's Notes\r\n\r\nDVD 2 contains all of the music rehearsals (sans Dress Rehearsal which will be featured on DVD 3).\r\n\r\nDVD 3 This DVD contains the complete Dress Rehearsal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8459b59e57ce07169ec5c8c64953cfbfc2eb85c9","amp;dn":"Roger+Waters+-+1990-07+Berlin+Wall+Rehearsals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8459b59e57ce07169ec5c8c64953cfbfc2eb85c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,89,181,158,87,206,7,22,158,197,200,198,73,83,207,191,194,235,133,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
