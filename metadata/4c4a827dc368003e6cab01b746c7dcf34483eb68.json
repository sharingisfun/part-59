Detail is great in the many close-ups. Colour is vivid, too. The video gets a bit blurry in action sequences. Some chroma bleeding occurs in the start with the ropes in the village. Audio sync varies from -25ms to -5ms throughout the film, which is not detectable without slowing the film down.\r\n\r\nI cannot verify the accuracy of the translation of the English subtitle but it seems to make sense. Sync is very good. Cantonese subtitles are less well synced but remain within 200ms throughout the film.\r\n\r\nI'll be seeding this the first two weeks 24/7, then for a few weeks in (European) evenings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c4a827dc368003e6cab01b746c7dcf34483eb68","amp;dn":"Journey+to+the+West%3A+Conquering+the+Demons+%282013%29+softsub%5BGhost%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c4a827dc368003e6cab01b746c7dcf34483eb68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,74,130,125,195,104,0,62,108,171,1,183,70,199,220,243,68,131,235,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
