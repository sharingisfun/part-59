After all, this is the teacher who secretly smiled when Maisie Miller fell off her chair that time. And then a teddy bear appears on her desk, with â€œYou're Greatâ€ written on its tummy. Miss Jones isn't a teddy bear kind of person. She's more of a hates-puppies-and-thinks-kittens-are-ugly kind of person. And that's when they know â€“ Miss Jones has been taken over by aliens. And now she's trying to turn them all into aliens, too.
