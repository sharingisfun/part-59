The contrast between these two eras becomes more vivid with the deletion of the years and events that bridged them. Released in 1965, Selflessness presents long-form pieces, likewise from two very distinct and separate eras of Coltrane's development. \r\n\r\nThe album's first two-thirds was recorded at the 1963 Newport Jazz Festival and consists of an amazingly deft rendition of Coltrane's take on the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein classic &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; as well as the glowingly affectionate &quot;I Want to Talk About You.&quot; Coltrane is backed on these numbers by the classic lineup of McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, and Roy Haynes, and the quartet absolutely crackles with the flowing joy that characterized its sound.\r\n\r\nTyner especially sparkles in his extended spotlight moments on &quot;My Favorite Things,&quot; arguably the best version Coltrane put to tape of this favorite. Fast forwarding two years to 1965, the 14-plus-minute extended atmospherics of &quot;Selflessness&quot; find Coltrane ramping up to the free-form spiritual style that he would work in for the short remainder of his life. \r\n\r\nThe large ensemble on this date included Pharoah Sanders' blistering tenor and Elvin Jones' sputtering drums working alongside second drummer Frank Butler as well as the reverb-doused percussion sounds of Juno Lewis. \r\n\r\nThe sprawling and sometimes aimless meditation comes off a little dippy as a result of the production and low-key playing, but it hints at a direction that would be fully articulated later on records like Sun Ship and the gorgeous Concert in Japan. Though the rapid changes in Coltrane's playing between 1963 and 1965 are thoroughly documented on other albums, taken as a whole, the contrast on Selflessness is striking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FAVORITE THINGS and I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOU, recorded live at the Newport Jazz Festival.
