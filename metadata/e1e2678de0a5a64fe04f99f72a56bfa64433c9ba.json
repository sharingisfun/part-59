Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Pat Dixon\r\n\r\nEpisode 297: Closing out the week, Ant explains his wardrobe, gives his thoughts on the docs â€œThe Suitcaseâ€ and â€œMaking a Murderer,â€ explains his new life routine, praises Trump, and tells us about attempting to stay off Twitter. Callers discusses his part in the Patrice O'Neal doc, tonight debate, his â€œgirlfriend pattern,â€ him possibly having depression, accepting refugees, USC requiring sexual history, and Ant once again tries to clarify his feelings and his wardrobe. He then gets into the Oscar nominees, shitbag Al Sharptonâ€™s â€œoutrage,â€ the Image Awards, hypocrisy in diversity, we see a hair-raising waffle house story, learn about boiling weaves, and the callers have their say on depression, seatbelt wearing, and car deaths vs. gun deaths. Rat tell us about a car accident he was in, Ant defends the â€œblack talk,â€ talks about his broadcasting freedom, a drone-catcher, porn technology, Charlie Sheen going to Mexico for a HIV cure, we go through a list of celebs who died of AIDS, learn about Brother Joeâ€™s â€œalmost AIDS,â€ chat about author Colin Flaherty, black awards shows, ASPCA commercials, homeless people with pets, and opinion changing to influence others opinions. Pat Dixon comes in to wrap up with Ant talking about having no limits, the new velvety desk, Alan Rickmanâ€™s death, jerking off, intrusive ads, KtCâ€™s mob ties, and loving the shows on TACS network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1e2678de0a5a64fe04f99f72a56bfa64433c9ba","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-01-14+Pat+Dixon+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1e2678de0a5a64fe04f99f72a56bfa64433c9ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,226,103,141,224,165,166,79,224,79,153,247,42,86,191,166,68,51,201,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
