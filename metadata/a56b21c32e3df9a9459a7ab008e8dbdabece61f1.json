Speed. Psycho-stunts. Spectacularly sick visuals. TrickStyle takes you on the race of your life!\r\nUnlike traditional racing games, TrickStyle's gameplay is based on the use of hundreds of stunts in order to win the game - in both single-player and multi-player modes. Gamers not only have to be fast, they have to master the game's stunts as well, thus allowing gamers to speed up, access shortcuts and slow opponents down while racing on futuristic hover boards. In addition to a huge velodrome (a skate park designed just for air surfers), gamers can race through gorgeous futuristic renditions of Tokyo, New York City and London. Each city is recognizable by its famous landmarks, and boasts unique challenges, such as avoiding traffic and pedestrians in bustling Manhattan. In addition, TrickStyle uses a node-based racing system, which allows gamers to create their own paths through the cities.\r\n400 tricks to master with special moves for all nine characters!\r\nCurve it up all over futuristic Manhattan, London and Tokyo.\r\nSessions at The Velodrome teach you the mad skills.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / 7 / 8 / 10\r\n1.8 GHz Processor\r\n512MB RAM (1 GB recommended)\r\n3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended)\r\n2GB HDD\r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a56b21c32e3df9a9459a7ab008e8dbdabece61f1","amp;dn":"TrickStyle+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a56b21c32e3df9a9459a7ab008e8dbdabece61f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,107,33,195,46,61,249,169,69,154,122,176,8,232,219,218,190,206,97,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
