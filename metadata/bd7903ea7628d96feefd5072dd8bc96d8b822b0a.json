Today, the Christian has the answer right in their own homes. Simply blow the dust off of Godâ€™s word, open up the pages and the answers are there. By studying Bible Prophecy, we can know in great detail where the world is headed and where we are right now. The Bible lays out a timeline that tells us what the world will be like just before the return of Jesus and what will happen immediately afterwards. By knowing what is coming it motivates us as Christians to tell our friends and family where theyâ€™re headed so they too can avoid the wrath of God that is coming on this wicked world. This study, Future Events, part of our Discipleship 102 study, will take you through four individual studies to prepare you for what is coming.\r\n\r\nVideo is H265 play with VLC player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd7903ea7628d96feefd5072dd8bc96d8b822b0a","amp;dn":"Billy+Crone+-+Future+Events+H265+%28Christian%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd7903ea7628d96feefd5072dd8bc96d8b822b0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,121,3,234,118,40,217,111,238,253,80,114,221,139,201,109,139,130,43,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
