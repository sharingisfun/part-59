It provides an overview of the issues behind this technological transition, and it provides, in depth, the science and technology related to cellulose for production of bioethanol and other biofuels. The book also highlights the main emerging routes that will serve as the source of important bio-generated products in the future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1c513b7e9e0eaa6425218a3f842b328dd8c122d","amp;dn":"Lignocellulosic+Biorefineries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1c513b7e9e0eaa6425218a3f842b328dd8c122d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,197,19,183,233,224,234,166,66,82,24,163,248,66,179,40,221,140,18,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
