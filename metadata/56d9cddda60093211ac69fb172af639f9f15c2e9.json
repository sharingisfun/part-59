You and your family will appreciate it.\r\nThink about soundtrack, trailer music, winter, love, warmth, bells, violins, ambience.\r\n\r\nAll the songs are in original lossless quality (ALAC - Apple Lossless), directly from the studio masters or from the original CDDA sources.\r\nEverything is perfectly tagged and has the cover art. Your iTunes will love it.\r\nI created a playlist with BeaTunes and also matched the songs by Key, so the transitions will be as perfect as possible. \r\nWhen you open the m3u8 playlist in iTunes, I recommend enabling Sound Check and Crossfade, both in iTunes Preferences. This way you'll have 4,5 hours of great music on your Christmas Eve without boring or silent moments.\r\n\r\nIf you like the music please think about the artists and buy their music, like I did. Most of the music is online available in lossless quality. Their albums are beautiful too!\r\n\r\nPlaylist:\r\n\r\n01 - Celtic Woman - O Holy Night.m4a\r\n02 - Future World Music - Journey Of Life.m4a\r\n03 - Audiomachine - The Secret Garden.m4a\r\n04 - Future World Music - Winter In New York.m4a\r\n05 - Future World Music - Young At Heart.m4a\r\n06 - Fox Amoore - A Million Lights (Feat.
