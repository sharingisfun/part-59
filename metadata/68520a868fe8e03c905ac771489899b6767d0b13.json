He will officially assume office at the end of June when outgoing President Benigno Aquino III completes his six-year term.\r\n\r\nâ€œAmong the candidates Duterte defeated in the election were the vice president and a former interior secretary, who was Aquino's preferred successor and had been supported by business circles.\r\n\r\nThe Aquino administration pushed ahead with fiscal reform, created a favorable investment environment and achieved annual economic growth of about 6 percent.
