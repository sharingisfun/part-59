P. Kothiyal, A. Srinivasan (CRC, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-981-4613-99-6\r\n\r\nBiomaterials research requires the union of materials scientists, engineers, biologists, biomedical doctors, and surgeons. Societal implications have invoked tremendous interest in this area of research in recent years. What started as a search for strong and durable implant materials has now led to path-breaking developments in tissue engineering, targeted drug delivery, and tissue scaffolds. Viable applications of mesoporous structures, polymer biocomposites, and fibers (synthetic and natural) in the areas of clinical orthopedics, controlled drug delivery, tissue engineering, orthodontics, etc., have emerged as relatively recent concepts.\r\n\r\nThis book presents recent results related to both materials aspects and implant issues. The focus is on structural, magnetic, antibacterial, bioactivity/compatibility, mechanical, and other related properties and the implication of these results on biomedical applications. The book discusses technical problems faced by the surgeon during implant fixation in total hip replacement and the selection of materials based on the patientâ€™s requirement. It also addresses recent advances in implant materials, including the reinforcement and biocompatibility issues","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb8687869b649eecf948f7ca0c614e288656d6a2","amp;dn":"Trends+in+Biomaterials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb8687869b649eecf948f7ca0c614e288656d6a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,134,135,134,155,100,158,236,249,72,247,202,12,97,78,40,134,86,214,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
