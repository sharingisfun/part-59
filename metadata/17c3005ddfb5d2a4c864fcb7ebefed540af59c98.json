Standing in the middle, examining his cellphone, is a man in an orange shirt, at 6-foot-2 appearing unusually tall among the other refugees.\r\n\r\nThis is Ahmad Majid and he stands out, not just for his height, but also for his air of command, his detachment, and the small village of men, women and children that appear to be following him. His brow is often knitted in an expression of apprehension, even when he smiles.\r\n\r\nI begin chatting with him, the first in what will be weeksâ€™ worth of conversation, in which he and his family gradually entrust me with the details of their lives and allow me to witness their struggle to maintain hope, pride and dignity over their long journey.\r\n\r\nThey have already traveled a long way by the time I meet them. Four days earlier they had crossed the Aegean from Turkey to Greece, with Ahmad helping to navigate. They show me a cellphone video of them bouncing across the waves in a sturdy rubber boat with a good motor. In the video, they are wearing life jackets and laughing.\r\n\r\nAhmadâ€™s wife, Jamila Khalil, 22 and head-turningly pretty, with pale skin and a faraway look that conjures Vermeerâ€™s â€œGirl With a Pearl Earring,â€ says the boat ride was the easiest part of the trip. Even after a harrowing journey out of Syria, they are still eager and to a large degree naÃ¯ve.\r\n \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/22/world/europe/syrian-refugees.html?_r=0\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17c3005ddfb5d2a4c864fcb7ebefed540af59c98","amp;dn":"a-family-swept-up-in-the-migrant-tide.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17c3005ddfb5d2a4c864fcb7ebefed540af59c98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,195,0,93,223,181,210,164,200,100,252,183,235,239,237,84,10,245,156,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
