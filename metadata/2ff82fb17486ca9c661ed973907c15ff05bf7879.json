The film tells the story of two families who find companionship during a Caribbean Christmas holiday, only to have their idyllic vacation disrupted by an unexpected visitor from the past. The movie was filmed entirely on location on the island of Puerto Rico in 2007, and has subsequently been rebroadcast on Lifetime every year during the holiday season as an annual Christmas film.\r\n\r\nPlot: Two families looking to escape painful holiday memories take a vacation to an exotic Caribbean island over Christmas. A widowed mother, Dana (Charlotte Ross), and her two sons, Chris (Devon Werkheiser) and Michael (Kenton Duty) meet a divorced father, Dan (Colin Ferguson), and his two daughters, Blair (Josie Loren) and Nell (Aria Wallace) when their cruise ship docks in Puerto Rico. Despite a rough start, the parents and kids begin to develop bonds over the course of their stay at a beautiful Puerto Rican beach resort. It looks like an idyllic Brady Bunch holiday for the two families as Dana and Dan try to put their personal tragedies behind them and begin to grow closer, until an unexpected visitor from the past appears and threatens their tentative romance. What promised to be a joyous Christmas filled with fresh hope and new relationships turns complicated as each member of the two families must sort out their feelings and choose their own path.\r\n\r\nCast (partial):\r\nCharlotte Ross ...

I'll see 100 people downloading and then activity goes to zero once they all get what they want.  It's unfortunate!  But, I seed my torrents 24/7, unless I'm doing a reboot or we experience a power outage.  If you start downloading one of my posts and it comes to a halt, don't give up on it, I'll be back online as soon as 'the internet God' allows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ff82fb17486ca9c661ed973907c15ff05bf7879","amp;dn":"Christmas+In+Paradise+%282007%29+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ff82fb17486ca9c661ed973907c15ff05bf7879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,248,47,177,116,134,202,156,102,30,217,115,144,124,21,255,5,191,120,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
