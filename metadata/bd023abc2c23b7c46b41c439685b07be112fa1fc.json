Dreyer's Gertrud, Der var engang en krig is the most important Danish film of the 1960s. It is a portrait of a 15-year-old boy from middle class Copenhagen during the German occupation. The occupation of 1940-45 has been described in several documentaries, most notably in the unique Your Freedom Is at Stake, based on illegally shot material and reflecting the views of the resistance movement - a view quite critical towards the official Danish collaboration policy. Sixteen feature films were inspired by this important period in recent Danish history, most of them stressing the heroic aspects of the resistance. Contrary to this approach, Der var engang en krig uses the war as a background, but reflects the daily life of the Danes in a more authentic and honest manner. It is the situations, the excellently written dialogue, the characters, and the way it brings a period to life which make the film engaging and emotionally rich.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 688x412, 25.000 fps, 1418 kbps, 01h28m25s\r\nAudio: AAC, 48000 Hz, stereo, 160 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Danish audio, English subtitles hardcoded\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/p5gtbztd3/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/exzqwwl8f/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/w12isf1xb/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4ezr7qikf/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ms0ciat1b/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd023abc2c23b7c46b41c439685b07be112fa1fc","amp;dn":"Der+var+engang+en+krig+-+Once+Upon+a+War+%281966+-+Denmark%29+WWII","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd023abc2c23b7c46b41c439685b07be112fa1fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,2,58,188,44,35,183,196,107,65,196,57,104,91,7,190,17,47,161,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
