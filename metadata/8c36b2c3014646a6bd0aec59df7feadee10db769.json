Trumpâ€™s Unfavorables. Weekend IN. Jim @mctaguej, Barronâ€™s. @lizpeek, Fiscal Times. @davidmdrucker @johnfund. Charles Kolstad, Stanford\r\n&quot;Years of solid job gains are failing to produce a breakout in wages, suppressing the spark needed for a sustained pickup in economic growth.\r\n\r\n&quot;U.S. employers for the past four years created more than 200,000 jobs a month on average. That has driven the unemployment rate down to 5% last month from above 8% in early 2012.\r\n\r\n&quot;But wages have shown little progress. Wages and salaries for private-sectors workers advanced 2% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Friday. The measure has grown near that rate, on average, since the start of 2012....&quot;\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/anemic-wage-growth-restraining-economy-1461956936\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nâ€œThe U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in roughly two years, climbing just 0.5 percent in the first three months of 2016.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. economy reported subpar numbers in the first quarter for the third straight year. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted 0.7 percent growth.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Commerce Department said the low growth was due to a pullback in spending by both businesses and consumers as the first few months of 2016 were filled with anxiety about the state of the global economy. The economy grew 1.4 percent in the last quarter of 2015.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) called the new numbers a &quot;real wake up call.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Todayâ€™s report is further proof that the President's economic policies are moving America in the wrong direction,&quot; he said in a statement.\r\n \nhttp://thehill.com/policy/finance/277986-economy-grows-just-05-percent-to-open-2016\r\n\r\n________\r\n \nhttp://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/04/28/Beat-Hillary-Trump-Has-Agree-Presidential-Makeover\r\n\r\n_________\r\n \nhttp://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/29/indiana-gov-mike-pence-make-significant-announcement-noon-speculation-focuses-ted-cruz-endorsement/83697052/\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\nOpportunities for advances in climate change economics\r\n \nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6283/292.full\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c36b2c3014646a6bd0aec59df7feadee10db769","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-Slow-Growth-Slows-Wages-Trump.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c36b2c3014646a6bd0aec59df7feadee10db769","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,54,178,195,1,70,70,166,189,10,236,89,223,127,234,222,225,13,183,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
