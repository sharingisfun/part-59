Stroker Strockmeyer, a former mattress salesman, likes his PI work because he gets to shoot people. But his partner, Hoop Schwartz, loves the job and never fires a gun intending to hit a target. The two use talking auto CARR, which is 20 years past state of the art. Being mediocre, they take jobs offered by those who can't afford competence","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e66238d29793f3a2c8f44db5b0d29b8d35d057c","amp;dn":"Stroker+%26amp%3B+Hoop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e66238d29793f3a2c8f44db5b0d29b8d35d057c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,102,35,141,41,121,63,58,44,143,68,219,91,13,41,184,211,93,5,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
