However, the band are now taking a more structured\r\napproach to song writing, with the addition of Charlotte James contributing to the\r\nwriting process.\r\n\r\nThe duo are considered pioneers of the electronic genre, and have produced four studio\r\nalbums, all garnering critical acclaim. They are known for their cinematic approach to\r\ntheir production, specifically with the use of orchestral sounds, which is particularly\r\nnotable on their debut album Wide Angle when they collaborated with the Russian Federal\r\nOrchestra. Also over their seventeen-year career, they have produced over 100 remixes\r\nfor over 40 artists.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio Information, Torrent File Contents And Specifications\r\n\r\n\r\nArtist / Group: Hybrid\r\nGenre: Electronic / Breaks / Breakbeat\r\nAlbum Release Year: 2001\r\nNumber of Tracks: 10\r\nLabel: Distinct'ive Breaks\r\nCatalog: DISNCD67\r\nTotal Playing Time: 1 Hours, 8 Minutes and 38 Seconds (68 Minutes)\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\r\nCodec Version: reference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\r\nEncoding Bit Rate (Average): 988 kbps\r\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Normal Stereo)\r\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio Files Source: Original Compact Disc's\r\nConverter / Encoder (From CD): EAC V1.1\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File ID Tag Format: VorbisComment\r\nTag Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\r\nImage Files: Front and Back Album Covers (embedded artwork within audio files)\r\nAdditional Files: LOG, CUE, MD5, FFP, M3U, foo dr and txt [Track List]\r\nTotal File Size: 491 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d92dad92714d1642446b17b9402b6927ef6fefcb","amp;dn":"Hybrid+-+Remix+And+Additional+Production+By...+%5B2001%5D+%5BFLAC+-+EA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d92dad92714d1642446b17b9402b6927ef6fefcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,45,173,146,113,77,22,66,68,107,23,185,64,43,105,39,239,111,239,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
