He lives to pass down his wisdom and his stories -- to teach those who would follow in his footsteps.\r\n\r\nThere is Heather, the healer who, in many ways, holds the clan together.\r\n\r\nThere is Elga, an outsider and the bringer of change.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is Loon, the next shaman, who is determined to find his own path. But in a world so treacherous, that journey is never simple -- and where it may lead is never certain.\r\n\r\nSHAMAN is a powerful, thrilling and heartbreaking story of one young man's journey into adulthood -- and an awe-inspiring vision of how we lived thirty thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Graeme Malcolm\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 96 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2593696aea0d1debc8e3b2fedf5c38f311022170","amp;dn":"Kim+Stanley+Robinson+-+Shaman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2593696aea0d1debc8e3b2fedf5c38f311022170","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,147,105,106,234,13,29,235,200,227,178,254,223,92,56,243,17,2,33,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
