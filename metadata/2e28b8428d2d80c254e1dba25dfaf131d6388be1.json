He would also see six of his albums go Gold from 1956 to 1961.\r\n\r\nAlong the way he was backed by some of the finest such orchestras of the period, including those of Millard Thomas, Henri Rene, Hugo Winterhalter, William Lorin, Tony Scott and Bob Corman. It was, in fact, Corman with his orchestra and chorus who backed him on his first Christmas album which initially came out in 1958 as RCA Victor 1887 with a quite different red sleeve cover.\r\n\r\nWhen a vinyl re-release came out in 1962 as RCA Victor 2626, and with the same cover seen here, it contained the original tracks, although the side 2 order was changed with the addition of the bonus track, Mary's Boy Child. Featured in Where The Little Jesus Sleeps and Mary, Mary are the guitars of Laurindo Almeida and Millard Thomas.\r\n\r\nThe decision to include Mary's Boy Child in 1962 was in response to popular demand, as it had been a # 12 Billboard Top 10 hit in 1956 on RCA Victor 47-6735 with the backing of the Lorin orchestra and the guitars of Thomas and Frantz Casseus (the flip was the non-seasonal Venezuela). That revamped album reached # 125 on Billboard's Pop Album charts in 1962, then charted again on their Christmas charts in 1964 (# 34), 1966 (# 58), and 1967 (# 47).
