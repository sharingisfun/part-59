Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Tom Shillue\r\n\r\nEpisode 303: Anthony is joined by Tom Shillue to chat about people who think the world is flat, Red Eye, dependable guests, dealing with odd schedules, and they pick apart a cop tazing video and one of Danny Most crooning. They then get into terrible celebrity endorsements, Abe Vigoda kicking the can, Barney Miller, The Waltons, Richard Dreyfuss, on-line shopping, drone delivery, robots, Transatlantic accents, and Tom waxes on old movies. The guys get back into Red Eye and the hosts, discuss Fox News haters, last nightâ€™s Democratic Town Hall, generic richness, buying and selling gold, Tom makes an early exit, and Ant continues on to chat with the in studio audience about the Patrice Oâ€™Neal benefit. After we see a clip from last nightâ€™s Town Hall, Ant talks about fake power moves, Michael Bloomberg, Rand Paulâ€™s description of Trump, an â€œAsk Amyâ€ hoax, the continuing Amy Schumer stealing saga, relationship guidance, doing impressions, Seth Meyersâ€™s Boston accent, and the day wraps with a few caller comments and suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e22c3aabedac406f57d3b40dbcdde9b37bdb12db","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-01-26+Tom+Shillue+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e22c3aabedac406f57d3b40dbcdde9b37bdb12db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,44,58,171,237,172,64,111,87,211,180,13,188,221,233,179,123,219,18,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
