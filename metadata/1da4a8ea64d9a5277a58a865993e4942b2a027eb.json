In addition, her slower physical development has made her very self-conscious about her body. Unhappy amongst her schoolmates, Sam finds herself increasingly drawn to two of the seniors at her work. As her relationship with them deepens, she finds worlds far more complex and intriguing than the one inhabited by her peers.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x464, 23.976 fps, 1800 Kbps, 01h38m25s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, 6 channel, 448 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/srolyctlf/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/b6pfzpf31/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/dwyrwwbrx/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/l2qizckv1/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/x3bz02s9p/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1da4a8ea64d9a5277a58a865993e4942b2a027eb","amp;dn":"Wet+Bum+-+aka+Surfacing+%282014+-+Canada%29+%5BTIFF+Rising+Stars%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1da4a8ea64d9a5277a58a865993e4942b2a027eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,164,168,234,100,217,165,39,122,88,168,101,153,62,73,66,178,160,39,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
