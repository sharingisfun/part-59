It is an insight into the practical, back-to-the-earth beekeeping lifestyle and well as the artisan cultivation of honey varieties.\r\nSupplementary support for this book lay in the fact that interest in tapping honeyâ€™s holistic and whole-health potential dovetails nicely into the natural health and green movements. Also, honey as natural, lower-calorie sweetener has garnered positive PR by those working against the obesity epidemic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6485c6b3ae1d4614dafe4e083041262ff993ad7c","amp;dn":"The+Backyard+Beekeeper%27s+Honey+Handbook+%282009%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6485c6b3ae1d4614dafe4e083041262ff993ad7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,133,198,179,174,29,70,20,218,254,78,8,48,65,38,47,249,147,173,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
