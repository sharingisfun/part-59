In fact, the opposite is true. The novel powers that our post-9/11 commanders in chief assumedâ€•endless detentions, military commissions, state secrets, broad surveillance, and moreâ€•are the culmination of a two-century expansion of presidential authority. But these new powers have been met with thousands of barely visible legal and political constraintsâ€•enforced by congressional committees, government lawyers, courts, and the mediaâ€•that have transformed our unprecedentedly powerful presidency into one that is also unprecedentedly accountable.\r\n\r\nThese constraints are the key to understanding why Obama continued the Bush counterterrorism program, and in this light, the events of the last decade should be seen as a victory, not a failure, of American constitutional government. We have actually preserved the framersâ€™ original idea of a balanced constitution, despite the vast increase in presidential power made necessary by this age of permanent emergency.â€\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d6174f0bb43619884c50ec26de390b5f3f28390","amp;dn":"john+batchelor%2Cconstitution%2CObama%2Cpresidency%2Cterrorism%2CJihad%2Cdro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d6174f0bb43619884c50ec26de390b5f3f28390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,97,116,240,187,67,97,152,132,197,14,194,109,227,144,181,243,242,131,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
