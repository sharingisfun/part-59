After the release of their second album &quot;Another Way to Shine&quot; Japanese label Wrong Again Records offered Amott a record in Heartwork  - his latest work with Carcass. Amott turned for help to a former Carnage colleague , vocalist and bassist Johan Liiva, as well as his younger brother Christopher, who at that time studied at a music school guitar class. With a session drummer Daniel Erlandsson (Eucharist) Arch Enemy released their first album &quot;Black Earth&quot;.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2014 the band announced the full-length album &quot;War Eternal&quot;, which was  released on Trooper Entertaiment in Japan and on Century Media Records in the rest of the world. The band also announced the change of vocalist: now the band will Elissa White Glatz, former lead singer of Canadian extreme metal band The Agonist. However, Angela Gossow remains as the business manager. Her departure from the stage, is justified by family circumstances and other personal reasons.
