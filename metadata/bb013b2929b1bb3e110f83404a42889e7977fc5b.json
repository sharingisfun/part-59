They just play music.&quot;\r\n \r\nThey didn't do it often enough. This two-CD set, â€œWazooâ€ (2007), the whole of a previously unissued concert in Boston, combines the complex, blaring tension of Zappa's written scores and round robins of directed improvisation, with Zappa soloing on guitar with unusual, groovin' restraint in &quot;The Grand Wazoo (Think It Over).&quot; &quot;Big Swifty,&quot; from 1972's Waka/Jawaka, opens with dervish woodwinds and elephant-stampede trombones, then hits and stays in high flash-your-chops gear. There is also a half-hour of the oratorio &quot;The Adventures of Greggery Peccary&quot; minus vocals, a plus that emphasizes the will and imagination of Zappa's composing and the fearlessness of the hot cats under his baton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Zappa\r\n\r\nWazoo\r\n\r\n(September 24, 1972 at the Music Hall, Boston, Massachusetts)\r\n\r\n2007\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2CDs / 2007 / VBR-V0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack List:\r\n\r\n\r\nCD 1:\r\n\r\n01.
