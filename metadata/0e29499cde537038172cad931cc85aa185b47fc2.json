If all goes as planned, the 11 satellites will be deployed approximately 20 minutes after liftoff, completing a 17-satellite, low Earth orbit constellation for ORBCOMM.\r\n\r\nThis mission also marks SpaceXâ€™s return-to-flight as well as its first attempt to land a first stage on land. The landing of the first stage is a secondary test objective.\r\n\r\nMission was a complete success!\r\n\r\nThis is the saved livestream losslessly converted from FLV to MP4.
