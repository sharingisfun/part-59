But some of her strongest work happens when she plays\r\nalone. â€œDes Pas Sur La Neigeâ€ (â€œFootprints in the Snowâ€) (Clean Feed) is her\r\nfirst solo piano recording, three long pieces that remain quiet and complex,\r\nelegant but tense. Itâ€™s not any kind of typical free-improvisation piano\r\nrecord; in fact, piano notes created in the customary way, by striking a key,\r\nare in the minority among the sounds on this record. Most of what you hear is\r\nmade by scraping and tapping and knocking and brushing inside the instrument,\r\nin focused, flexible patterns. (Thereâ€™s also a great sense of physical space in\r\nthis recording, produced either by multiple microphones or overdubs, as well as\r\nsome layers of sound I canâ€™t quite place, including a faint electronic tone.)\r\nThe album lasts for little more than an hour, and remains cohesive in concept\r\nand sound. Itâ€™s great not to know exactly how she does that.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Stef \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2015/07/eve-risser-des-pas-sur-la-neige-clean.html\r\n\r\nBy Brian Olewnick \nhttp://www.squidsear.com/cgi-bin/news/newsView.cgi?newsID=1813\r\n\r\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards\r\n\r\nBy Marcin Jachnik (pl)\r\n\r\nBy Jan Granlie (no) \nhttp://salt-peanuts.eu/record/eve-risser/\r\n\r\nBy Sara Quaresma CapitÃ£o (pt) \nhttp://www.mutante.pt/2015/02/novos-albuns-ii-clean-feed15/\r\n\r\nBy Vincenzo Roggero (it) \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/des-pas-sur-la-neige-eve-risser-clean-feed-records-review-by-vincenzo-roggero.php\r\n\r\nPar Franpi (fr) \nhttp://www.franpisunship.com/archives/2015/05/10/32032165.html\r\n\r\nPar Philippe MÃ©ziat (fr) \nhttp://www.citizenjazz.com/Eve-Risser-3472153.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:547b63d8aa461232e318078b5956fb06495b50f7","amp;dn":"Eve+Risser+-+Des+Pas+Sur+La+Neige+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"547b63d8aa461232e318078b5956fb06495b50f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,123,99,216,170,70,18,50,227,24,7,139,89,86,251,6,73,91,80,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
