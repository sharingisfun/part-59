Schwalbe argues that study of masculinity has lost touch with its feminist roots and has been seduced by the politically safe notion of 'multiple masculinities'. Manhood Acts delineates the practices males use to construct 'women' and 'men' as unequal categories. Schwalbe reclaims the radical feminist insights that gender is a field of domination, not a field of play, and that manhood is fundamentally about exerting or resisting control. Manhood Acts arrives at the conclusion that abolishing gender as a system of oppression will require more than transgressive self-presentation. It will be necessary to end the exploitive economic relationships that necessitate manhood itself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70b2d779587429876bfd24adcc5c72e65d7d8df4","amp;dn":"Manhood+Acts+-+Michael+Schwalbe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70b2d779587429876bfd24adcc5c72e65d7d8df4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,178,215,121,88,116,41,135,107,253,36,173,204,92,114,230,93,125,141,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
