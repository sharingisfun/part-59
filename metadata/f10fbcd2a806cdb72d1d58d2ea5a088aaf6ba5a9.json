Silver Bull. @danhenninger, WSJ Editorial. @simonconstable, Forbes\r\nJohn Batchelor April 28 , 2016\r\n\r\nWant to know which way Americaâ€™s political winds are blowing? When Bill Clinton speaks, listen.\r\n\r\nTalking in Spokane last month about the U.S. economy, the former president mentioned â€œthe awful legacy of the last eight years.â€ In Indianapolis Tuesday, Mr. Clinton let the same cat out of the bag:\r\n\r\nâ€œThe problem is, 80% of the American people are still living on what they were living on the day before the [2008 financial] crash. And about half the American people, after you adjust for inflation, are living on what they were living on the last day I was president 15 years ago. So thatâ€™s whatâ€™s the matter.â€\r\n\r\nHours later, Hillary Clinton delivered her victory speech in Philadelphia after winning four of five primaries against Bernie Sanders. With that speech, the great Clinton pivot has begun. By the time sheâ€™s done repositioning herself for the fall campaign run, most likely against Donald Trump, Hillaryâ€™s pivots will make Stephen Curry look like a little old lady.\r\n\r\nNote well this phrase toward the end: â€œSo my friends, if you are a Democrat, an Independent or a thoughtful Republican . . . .â€\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/the-clinton-pivot-begins-1461799244?tesla=y\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nForbes Video: Why Silver May Head to $25\r\n \nhttp://www.forbes.com/video/4858023496001\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f10fbcd2a806cdb72d1d58d2ea5a088aaf6ba5a9","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-Clintons-Own-Triangulation.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f10fbcd2a806cdb72d1d58d2ea5a088aaf6ba5a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,15,188,210,168,6,205,183,45,29,88,210,234,90,8,138,175,107,165,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
