Some of the most unique are birds of paradise. With plenty of food such as nuts and fruits and very few natural predators, they've been able to leisurely hone their courting skills. The ribbon-tailed astrapia flaps its long white tail feathers, while the blue bird-of-paradise unfurls its feathers to create a pulsating eye-like shape. Since they live deep in the jungle, their courtship displays have long been steeped in mystery. Tadashi Shimada, a wildlife photographer who's made numerous visits to New Guinea over the years, has for the first time ever captured images of the blue bird-of-paradise's courting behavior. This program delves into the fascinating world of these beautiful and mysterious birds.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/Designed-to-Dance-Birds-of-Paradise-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9e/Designed-to-Dance-Birds-of-Paradise-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/43/Designed-to-Dance-Birds-of-Paradise-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Designed-to-Dance-Birds-of-Paradise-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/50/Designed-to-Dance-Birds-of-Paradise-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Designed-to-Dance-Birds-of-Paradise-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/Designed-to-Dance-Birds-of-Paradise-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/Designed-to-Dance-Birds-of-Paradise-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/08/Designed-to-Dance-Birds-of-Paradise-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19.5 (~3939Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.53 VBR 48KHz (~127Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 49 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.39 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://pf.nhk-ep.co.jp/detail/1624","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26102b966c50b6ccab2dc2e40831725d0ac10c6a","amp;dn":"NHK+Wildlife+2011+Designed+to+Dance+Birds+of+Paradise+720p+x264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26102b966c50b6ccab2dc2e40831725d0ac10c6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,16,43,150,108,80,182,204,171,45,194,228,8,49,114,93,10,193,12,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
