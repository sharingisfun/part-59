There isnâ€™t really much to see, because this happened at night. However, I must repeat that this happened at night. In other words, SpaceX was able to bring its first stage down accurately in the middle of the ocean onto a tiny barge in the dark.\r\n\r\nWho says the impossible is not possible?\r\n\r\nâ€œDuring the live telecast, the audience broke out into a chant of â€œUSA! USA!â€, as they did after the previous first stage landings. Can you guess why?\r\n \nhttp://behindtheblack.com/behind-the-black/points-of-information/spacexs-second-first-stage-barge-landing/\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\nâ€œWatch the last Blue Origin landing, from the rocket May 10, 2016 at 9:04 am Robert Zimmerman\r\n\r\nâ€œThe competition heats up: Blue Origin has released footage taken from the New Shepard propulsion module as it returned to Earth and landed.\r\n\r\nâ€œI have embedded the footage below the fold.
