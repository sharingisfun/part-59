Flynn and Michael Ledeen.\r\n\r\nOriginally a social worker, Sherman began her career working to help battered women and the urban poor.\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Sherman\r\n\r\nAfter working as CEO and President of the Fannie Mae Foundation, she then returned to the State Department as Madeleine Albright's counselor, with the rank of Ambassador, appointed by President Bill Clinton and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. She advised Secretary Albright on issues of foreign policy, provided guidance to the Department and undertook special assignments.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Kim argued that his countryâ€™s nuclear weapons were purely for defense and deterrence, in response to hostile policies from the United States and its allies, all a familiar repetition of language from North Korean speeches over many years. But in much of the foreign press coverage of his remarks, Kim got what he wanted: The media detected a new tone amidst all the familiar rhetoric. For those Westerners obsessed with finding conciliatory gestures by nuclear-aspirant authoritarian regimes like Iran and North Korea, the new tone is never hard to find.â€¨â€¨Pyongyang may also sense a fast-moving chance to reprise circumstances at the end of the Clinton administration, when the prospect of Americaâ€™s president himself traveling to the North seemed very real. Although Kimâ€™s father had to be satisfied with a visit by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Obama would be an easier get. Kim could figure that even a farewell visit by peripatetic Secretary of State John Kerry would at least return the North to the status quo in 2000, after long years of isolation from Washingtonâ€™s top leadership.â€¨â€¨Moreover, North Korea plays a long game. Jan. 20, 2017, is hardly far off. Kim may be calculating that Hillary Clinton would like a significant foreign-policy accomplishment early in her presidency, thereby demonstrating her seriousness and, early on, setting herself ahead of Obamaâ€™s international pace. And while Donald Trump authored â€œThe Art of the Deal,â€ Kim knows that Pyongyang has outmatched Washington in every negotiation since the Korean War. He may think the challenge is worth the riskâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.bostonherald.com/opinion/op_ed/2016/05/bolton_n_korea_hoping_to_hoodwink_us_again_on_nukes\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦By transferring power from Parliament in London to conference rooms in Brussels, the EU has created a democratic deficit that more and more people across the European continent increasingly resent.\r\n\r\nThe facile attempt to liken a United States of Europe to the United States of America cannot obscure the reality of two widely divergent historical experiences. America grew essentially from the original 13 colonies outward in a pattern where a common language, culture and national philosophy spread across North America over an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the EU is an entirely top-down project, imposed over an ancient continent of widely diverse peoples, languages, customs and religions. And even America had differences sufficiently profound to provoke an almost unimaginably bloody civil war.\r\n\r\nThere is an inherent economic risk in abandoning arrangements and institutions built up over time. But in the sweep of European history, the EU is a newcomer. It makes sense for Britain exit now rather than wait until disaster strikes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObama should be smart enough to understand thatâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Sherman\r\n \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2015/08/07/politics/wendy-sherman-iran-nuclear-deal-harvard/\r\n \nhttp://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2014/10/meet_wendy_sherman_architect_of_appeasement_disasters_in_nuclear_negotiations_with_north_korea_and_iran.html\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31a51169d8f1773da89797e05de090377ec42766","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+No+to+N+Korea+Nukes+Bolton.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31a51169d8f1773da89797e05de090377ec42766","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,165,17,105,216,241,119,61,168,151,151,224,93,224,144,55,126,196,39,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
