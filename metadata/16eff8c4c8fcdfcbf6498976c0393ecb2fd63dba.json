Claudia Rosett, PJMedia. @gordongchang, Daily Beast. @thadmccotter, WJR\r\nJohn Batchelor Podcast May 9,2016\r\n\r\n&quot;...Remarkable. But don't credit Obama alone for the creative talent behind these fictions. In a story just posted by The New York Times Magazine, veteran reporter David Samuels brings us a long, appalling and masterfully reported look behind the scenes at influential White House senior staffer Ben Rhodes, &quot;The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama's Foreign Policy Guru.&quot; Rhodes, 38, serves as assistant to the president, deputy national security advisor for strategic communications and speechwriting, and oversees, as the White House web site tells us, &quot;President Obama's national security communications, speechwriting and global engagement.&quot;\r\n\r\nHow did Ben Rhodes get there? From New York prep-school, Rhodes went on to study creative writing at New York University. He published one short story, before enlisting his mother's connections to enter the world of foreign policy. He then rose to become, as Samuels describes it, &quot;the master shaper and retailer of Obama's foreign-policy narratives, at a time when the killer wave of social media has washed away the sand castles of the traditional press.&quot; Samuels notes, &quot;His lack of conventional real-world experience of the kind that normally precedes responsibility for the fate of nations -- like military or diplomatic service, or even a master's degree in international relations, rather than creative writing -- is still startling.&quot;\r\n \nhttps://pjmedia.com/claudiarosett/meet-the-flimflam-man-behind-obamas-foreign-policy-narrative/?singlepage=true\r\n \nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/06/a-stunning-profile-of-ben-rhodes-the-asshole-who-is-the-presidents-foreign-policy-guru/\r\n\r\n: http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonchang/2016/05/08/did-china-just-steal-360-billion-from-america/#76d334093d40\r\n \nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36240040\r\n \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16eff8c4c8fcdfcbf6498976c0393ecb2fd63dba","amp;dn":"Obama%27s+Bitch+Ben+Rhodes+Iran+Deal.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16eff8c4c8fcdfcbf6498976c0393ecb2fd63dba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,239,248,196,200,252,223,203,246,73,137,118,192,57,62,203,47,214,61,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
