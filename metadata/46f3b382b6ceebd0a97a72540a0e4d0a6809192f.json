Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Joe DeVito\r\n\r\nEpisode 301: Ending TACS week, Ant does a little train bitching before (not a singer) Joe DeVito takes a seat at the desk to reminisce about the old days of recording, bands and breakups, growing up nerdy, pot, pump houses, school teachers and classes, cool kid drug dealers, and not applying yourself. They stay in â€œold school landâ€ discussing putting their dick in things, chicks diddling, almost shooting loads at school dances, erotic parachutes, artsy kids, and they take a look at the GED test. We watch some Aussie aquatic videos, Joe and Ant talk about fear in the water, hot celebrity daughters, the big upcoming snow storm, crybaby monster Daniel Holtzclaw, we get â€œmusicalâ€ with a shitbag family video, and go through some OK Cupid stats on love and aging. They also get into the latest on Amy Schumer, bombing, shitty material, the callers chime in to talk more about Amy, and the guys wrap up talking about bad Boston weather, Mount Everest, and an article about detoxing your vag with herb balls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46f3b382b6ceebd0a97a72540a0e4d0a6809192f","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-01-21+Joe+DeVito+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46f3b382b6ceebd0a97a72540a0e4d0a6809192f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,243,179,130,182,206,235,208,169,122,114,84,10,14,77,10,104,9,25,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
