Compared to the rest of her family, it's true. But even with their killer dead of an overdose, Jenna is still trying to find peace twenty-five years later.\r\n\r\nBut The Truth\r\nOn leave from her forensic artist job, Jenna returns to Nashville, the city where she lost so much. Instead of closure, she finds a new horror. Detective Rick Morgan needs Jenna's expertise in identifying the skeletal remains of a young child. The case jogs hazy half-buried memories--and a nagging dread that Jenna's ordeal hasn't ended.\r\n\r\nIs Even Worse\r\nNow other women are dying. And as the links between these brutal killings and Jenna's past becomes clear, she knows this time, a madman will leave no survivors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbac9fe4c783980762655a7c1afe66ae3361533b","amp;dn":"Mary+Burton-Be+Afraid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbac9fe4c783980762655a7c1afe66ae3361533b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,172,159,228,199,131,152,7,98,101,90,124,26,254,102,174,51,97,83,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
