Not so much a digest of Rivette's legendary 12-hour version (hardly ever screened, its title is Out 1: Noli Me Tangere) as a ghost and a reworking of some of the same material ('a critique', Rivette himself says), it's a challenging and terrifying journey for all who can bear with it. As Richard Roud put it: 'Cinema will never be the same, and neither will I.'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12136e2d09b03cf5152cb86062f5f5a89feedefe","amp;dn":"Out+1%3A+Spectre+1972+BRRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12136e2d09b03cf5152cb86062f5f5a89feedefe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,19,110,45,9,176,60,245,21,44,184,96,98,245,245,168,159,238,222,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
