Specifically, Iâ€™ve been thinking about how amazing it is that Haynes directed both Velvet Goldmine and Far From Heaven. Theyâ€™re both pitch-perfect period pastiches of very, very different times and places.\r\n\r\nWhich makes him a perfect choice for adapting The Price of Salt, Patricia Highsmithâ€™s midcentury lesbian romance novel. Itâ€™s been an interesting journey into propriety for The Price of Saltâ€”Highsmith originally published it under the pseudonym of Claire Morgan and didnâ€™t claim it as her own work for decades, and now itâ€™s been given the sort of classy, stylish, and polished treatment that will undoubtedly garner it attention and awards come awards season. (Which is not that far away!) \r\n\r\nThis is not, to randomly grab a recent disappointing mainstream film about ladies in love, Jennyâ€™s Wedding, offering remedial lessons on lesbian identity and apologetically tap-dancing around anything a very narrow segment of the audience might find uncomfortable (i.e, expressing romantic same-sex affection). This is a glossy retro drama in its fullest flush that rightfully assumes that anyone interested in seeing this picture is going to be more than fine with its content and wastes absolutely no time on coddling a close-minded audience.\r\n\r\nAnd thatâ€™s really refreshing, although the release of The Danish Girl is a huge reminder that weâ€™ve got a very, very long way to go when it comes to LGBT representation onscreen. (Everything I read about The Danish Girl makes my skin crawl. I hope someone makes a proper adaptation of Elbeâ€™s own writings in the future.) Obviously, the legal and social realities of being a queer woman in midcentury America are obstacles for our heroines, but we never see either of them agonize over their attraction to another woman. While Rooney Maraâ€™s Therese never talks it out seriously with anyone beyond prodding her erstwhile boyfriend for any first hand accounts of same-sex relationships, itâ€™s clear that her sudden connection to and longing for Cate Blanchettâ€™s Carol answers several questions for her. Itâ€™s as if she can now see the previously hidden world of queer women, making impressed but tentative eyes at a butch/femme couple she encounters in a record store and suddenly aware, at a party, that a girl chatting to her is interested in her and that any interest on her part would be welcome. And Carol has a firm hand on who she is and how fundamental that is to her living a full life. When her husband accuses her of becoming a woman â€œlike thatâ€ (referring to her friend Abbi), she snarls that he married a woman like that.\r\n\r\nCarol delves into Carolâ€™s identity as a queer mother in a way that The Price of Salt, written exclusively from Thereseâ€™s perspective, never did. Being a beautiful historical film about women in love already sets Carol apart, but I think that itâ€™s this exploration that really makes this film unique. Carol is a mother and she absolutely adores her daughter, Rindy. But she lives in a set of historical, social, and personal circumstances that ask her to deny her agency and any hope of love in order to be a motherâ€¦ and absolutely nothing else. \r\n\r\nIn the eyes of Harge and Hargeâ€™s divorce lawyers, Carolâ€™s â€œlifestyleâ€ indicates that she is an unfit mother, because you â€œcanâ€™tâ€ be a lesbian woman and a mother at the same time. (That specific nuance shouldnâ€™t be lost, but the situation also recalls ideas about women being either mothers or lovers.) And Carol struggles with this, actively, sometimes contemplating giving in so she can be with her daughter. When Carol has to make, finally, the heartbreaking decision that she does just to live a life as a full human being, itâ€™s both a victory and a loss.\r\n\r\nThe film is full of quiet, simmering performances, with little on the surface that nonetheless indicate the immense internal processes of the characters themselves. Thereâ€™s been a lot of talk about how good Blanchettâ€™s performance is, and itâ€™s all very well-deserved. Unfortunately, a lot of Cate Blanchettâ€™s acting choices as Carol recalled my mother too specifically (like, direct quote specifically) for me to ever really get over that hurdle, which wasâ€¦ fun. But Blanchett and Mara have a deceptively prim chemistry thatâ€™s absolutely explosive. \r\n\r\nFor the first half of the film, as Therese gets closer and closer to Carol without ever articulating to herself why, itâ€™s almost like Carol is a strange, glamorous compulsion. Neither ever say anything about their attraction to each other until they succumb to it in a motel. In a lesser film, that might feel odd, but in this film, where every casual touch between the lovers is explosive, it works perfectly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd87eabb481cb65b0716b1eb2f312cec6ea9a78a","amp;dn":"Carol+2015+DVDScr+480p+x264+Aac+Mkv+Makalakato","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd87eabb481cb65b0716b1eb2f312cec6ea9a78a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,135,234,187,72,28,182,91,7,22,177,235,47,49,44,236,110,169,167,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
