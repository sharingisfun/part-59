The Music that is. \r\nThe Video however was lame","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670feab3decff41451a1146a916a29d37de242f6","amp;dn":"V.A.-+Dracula+2000+OST+2000+FLAC+%28Thrash+Metal+Compilation%29ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670feab3decff41451a1146a916a29d37de242f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,15,234,179,222,207,244,20,81,161,20,106,145,106,41,211,125,226,66,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
